Count the number of ways to construct the target string



Given an array of strings A, each of the same length and a target string S,
find the number of ways to construct the target string using characters from
strings in the given array such that the indices of the characters used in
string construction form a strictly increasing sequence. Multiple characters
can also be used from the same string. Since the answer can be very large,
take modulo with (10^9 + 7)  

**Examples:**

    
    
    **Input :**  A = ["adc", "aec", "erg"], S = "ac"
    **Output :** 4
    Target string can be formed in following ways :
    1) 1st character of "adc" and the 3rd character of "adc".
    2) 1st character of "adc" and the 3rd character of "aec".
    3) 1st character of "aec" and the 3rd character of "adc".
    4) 1st character of "aec" and the 3rd character of "aec".
    
    **Input :** A = ["afsdc", "aeeeedc", "ddegerg"], S = "ae"
    **Output :** 12
    

Recommended: Please try your approach on _**_{IDE}_**_ first, before moving on
to the solution.

###  **Approach** :

  * We will use Dynamic Programming to solve the problem. 
  * For each string in the array, store the positions in which characters occurred in the string in a common list (L). Our aim is to use the characters whose indices form a strictly increasing sequence, so it doesnâ€™t matter which string they come from. 
  * Traverse the target string, and keep the information of the previously picked index (prev). For the current position of the target, string check whether this character has occurred at any index greater than prev by searching in L. This can be done naively using recursion but we can memorize it using dp table.   

    
    
    Following are the states of dp :
    dp[pos][prev], 
    where pos represents the position we are at in the target string, 
    and prev represents the previously picked index.

**Time complexity :** O(M * N2), where M is the length of the target string,
and N is the length of each of the array strings.

### Approach: (Dynamic programming + counter+twopointers)

  1. The idea is to First store all the occurrences of the string by traversing all the possible positions in a default dictionary
  2. Now define another function and start from the 0th position by placing the two pointers over the 0th index and start recursion
  3. For the recursion first, we should define the base cases in order to terminate the recursion at some point

Base cases are mentioned below:

> 1.if i==n: # if i is equal to n
>
> return 1 #return
>
> 2\. if start==m: # if start is equal to m
>
> return 0 #
>
> 1.In the first base case if the given i == n that means only one character
> exists we simple return 1
>
>  
>
>
>  
>
>
> 2\. if the start == length of the first character of the string we return 0
> since we just terminate our recursion

Main condition:

  * Now we will perform the pair recursion and check whether the target can be formed from the given string if yes we will simply increment the counter:

> ans = 0 # initilaize the ans with 0
>
> ans += back(i, start + 1) # recursive call and stroe the result in ans
> variable

  * Likewise, we will multiply the recursion call with the given string and check whether the target can be generated from the string:

> if positions[start][target[i]]: # check the condition
>
> ans += positions[start][target[i]] * back(i + 1, start + 1) # multiply with
> the each charecter and the recursive call

  * Finally, we return the answer

    
    
     **Time complexity:** O(2^n)
    **space complexity: O(N)**
