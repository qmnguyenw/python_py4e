0/1 Knapsack Problem to print all possible solutions



Given weights and profits of **N** items, put these items in a knapsack of
capacity **W**. The task is to print all possible solutions to the problem in
such a way that there are no remaining items left whose weight is less than
the remaining capacity of the knapsack. Also, compute the maximum profit.

 **Examples:**

>  **Input:** Profits[] = {60, 100, 120, 50}  
> Weights[] = {10, 20, 30, 40}, W = 40  
>  **Output:**  
>  10: 60, 20: 100,  
> 10: 60, 30: 120,  
> Maximum Profit = 180  
>  **Explanation:**  
>  Maximum profit from all the possible solutions is 180
>
>  **Input:** Profits[] = {60, 100, 120, 50}  
> Weights[] = {10, 20, 30, 40}, W = 50  
>  **Output:**  
>  10: 60, 20: 100,  
> 10: 60, 30: 120,  
> 20: 100, 30: 120,  
> Maximum Profit = 220  
>  **Explanation:**  
>  Maximum profit from all the possible solutions is 220

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Approach:** The idea is to make pairs for the weight and the profits of the
items and then try out all permutations of the array and including the weights
until their is no such item whose weight is less than the remaining capacity
of the knapsack. Meanwhile after including an item increment the profit for
that solution by the profit of that item.
