Maximum non-attacking Knights that can be placed on an N*M Chessboard



Given an **N*M** chessboard. The task is to find the maximum number of knights
that can be placed on the given chessboard such that no knight attack some
other knight.

 **Example**

>  **Input:** N = 1, M = 4  
>  **Output:** 4  
> Place a knight on every cell of the chessboard.
>
>  **Input:** N = 4, M = 5  
>  **Output:** 10

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Approach:** As we know that a knight can attack in two ways. Here are the
places which he can attack.

Here, in the picture, the knight is on white color and attacks only the black
color. Thus. we concluded that a knight can attack only on a different color.  
We can take help of this fact and use it for our purpose. Now as we know
knight attacks on different color so we can keep all knights on the same color
i.e. all on white or all on black. Thus making the highest number of knights
which can be placed.  
To find the number of black or white, it is simply half of the total blocks on
board.

> Total Blocks = n * m  
> Blocks of the same color = (n * m) / 2

 **Corner cases:**

  * If there is only a single row or column. Then all the blocks can be filled by knights as a knight cannot attack in the same row or column.

  * If there are only two rows or columns. Then every two columns (or rows) will be filled with knights and every consecutive two columns (or rows) will remain empty. As demonstrated in the picture.
