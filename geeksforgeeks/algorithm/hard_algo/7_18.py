Minimum increment/decrement to make array non-Increasing



Given an array a, your task is to convert it into a non-increasing form such
that we can either increment or decrement the array value by 1 in minimum
changes possible.

 **Examples :**

    
    
     **Input :** a[] = {3, 1, 2, 1}
    **Output :** 1
    **Explanation :**
    We can convert the array into 3 1 1 1 by
    changing 3rd element of array i.e. 2 
    into its previous integer 1 in one step
    hence only one step is required.
    
    **Input :** a[] = {3, 1, 5, 1}
    **Output :** 4
    We need to decrease 5 to 1 to make array sorted
    in non-increasing order.
    
    **Input :** a[] = {1, 5, 5, 5}
    **Output :** 4
    We need to increase 1 to 5.

Recommended: Please try your approach on _**_{IDE}_**_ first, before moving on
to the solution.

 **Brute-Force approach:** We consider both possibilities for every element
and find a minimum of two possibilities.

**Efficient Approach:** Calculate the sum of absolute differences between the
final array elements and the current array elements. Thus, the answer will be
the sum of the difference between the ith element and the smallest element
occurred until then. For this, we can maintain a min-heap to find the smallest
element encountered till then. In the min-priority queue, we will put the
elements and new elements are compared with the previous minimum. If new
minimum is found we will update it, this is done because each of the next
element which is coming should be smaller than the current minimum element
found till now. Here, we calculate the difference so that we can get how much
we have to change the current number so that it will be equal or less than
previous numbers encountered till. Lastly, the sum of all these differences
will be our answer as this will give the final value up to which we have to
change the elements.

Below is the implementation of the above approach:
