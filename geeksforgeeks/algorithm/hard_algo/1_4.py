Minimum Cost using Dijkstra by reducing cost of an Edge



Given an undirected graph of N nodes and M edges of the form {X, Y, Z} such
that there is an edge between **X** and **Y** with cost **Z**. The task is to
find the minimum cost to traverse from source node **1** to destination node
**N** such we are allowed to reduce the cost of only one path during traversal
by 2.

 **Examples:**

>  **Input:** N = 3, M = 4, Edges = {{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {1, 3, 7}, {2, 1,
> 5}}  
>  **Output:** 2  
>  **Explanation:**

>  Minimum Cost from source node 1 to destination node N is = 3/2 + 1 = 1 + 1
> = 2.

>  **Input:** N = 3, M = 3, Edges = {{2, 3, 1}, {1, 3, 7}, {2, 1, 5}}  
>  **Output:** 2

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Approach:** The idea is to consider every edge and try to minimize the
overall cost by reducing its cost. The main idea is to break the path between
source to destination into the source to any vertex **u** i.e., **path(1 to
u)** and from destination to any vertex **v** i.e., **path(n to v)** for all u
and v. Below are the steps:

  

  

  1. Perform a Dijkstra Algorithm to find the single source shortest path for all the vertex from source **node 1** and store it in an array as **dist_from_source[]**.
  2. Perform a Dijkstra Algorithm to find the single source shortest path for all the vertex from source **node N** and store it in an array as **dist_from_dest[]**.
  3. Initialise the minimum cost(say **minCost** ) as maximum value.
  4. Traverse the given edges and for each edges reduce the current cost to half and update the minimum cost as:  

> minCost = min(minCost, dist_from_source[u] + c/2 + dist_from_dest[v])  
> where,  
> c is the cost of current edge,  
> dist_from_source[u] is cost of path from node 1 to u  
> dist_from_source[v] is cost of path from node v to N

  5. Print the value of **minCost** after the above step.

Below is the implementation of the above approach:
