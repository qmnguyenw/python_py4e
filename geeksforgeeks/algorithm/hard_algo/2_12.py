First Fit algorithm in Memory Management using Linked List



 **First Fit Algorithm for Memory Management:** The first memory partition
which is sufficient to accommodate the process is allocated.

We have already discussed first fit algorithm using arrays in this article.
However, here we are going to look into another approach using a linked list
where the deletion of allocated nodes is also possible.

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input:** blockSize[] = {100, 500, 200}
            processSize[] = {417, 112, 426, 95} 
    **Output:**
    Block of size 426 can't be allocated
    Tag    Block ID    Size
    0         1        417
    1         2        112
    2         0        95
    After deleting block with tag id 0.
    Tag    Block ID    Size
    1         2        112
    2         0        95
    3         1        426

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Approach:** The idea is to use the memory block with a unique tag id. Each
process of different sizes are given block id, which signifies to which memory
block they belong to, and unique tag id to delete particular process to free
up space. Create a free list of given memory block sizes and allocated list of
processes.

  

  

 **Create allocated list:**  
Create an allocated list of given process sizes by finding the first memory
block with sufficient size to allocate memory from. If the memory block is not
found, then simply print it. Otherwise, create a node and add it to the
allocated linked list.

 **Delete process:**  
Each process is given a unique tag id. Delete the process node from the
allocated linked list to free up some space for other processes. After
deleting, use the block id of the deleted node to increase the memory block
size in the free list.

Below is the implementation of the approach:
