Difference Between Symmetric and Asymmetric Key Encryption



 **Symmetric Key Encryption:**  
Encryption is a process to change the form of any message in order to protect
it from reading by anyone. In Symmetric-key encryption the message is
encrypted by using a key and the same key is used to decrypt the message which
makes it easy to use but less secure. It also requires a safe method to
transfer the key from one party to another.

 **Asymmetric Key Encryption:**  
Asymmetric Key Encryption is based on public and private key encryption
technique. It uses two different key to encrypt and decrypt the message. It is
more secure than symmetric key encryption technique but is much slower.
**Symmetric Key Encryption**|  **Asymmetric Key Encryption**|  It only
requires a single key for both encryption and decryption.| It requires two key
one to encrypt and the other one to decrypt.| The size of cipher text is same
or smaller than the original plain text.| The size of cipher text is same or
larger than the original plain text.| The encryption process is very fast.|
The encryption process is slow.| It is used when a large amount of data is
required to transfer.| It is used to transfer small amount of data.| It only
provides confidentiality.| It provides confidentiality, authenticity and non-
repudiation.| Examples: 3DES, AES, DES and RC4| Examples: Diffie-Hellman, ECC,
El Gamal, DSA and RSA| In symmetric key encryption, resource utilization is
low as compared to asymmetric key encryption.| In asymmetric key encryption,
resource utilization is high.
