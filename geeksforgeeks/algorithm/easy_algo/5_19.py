Cracking Technical Interviews



There are two kinds of technical interviews. For service-based companies like
TCS, Accenture, Tech Mahindra, Wipro and the other one is product based
companies. Cracking the interviews of service based company is easier than
Product.

 **Service Based Companies:** For a service based company, all they require is
that if you are able to explain the technical terms and if you are able to
communicate to them or not. They will be asking the questions related to their
requirement. Like oops concept or if you are applying for specific domain like
react or node profile then they will ask the questions related to that. If you
are able to communicate to them and explain the things, you will be hired.
People from the non technical background, having basic technical knowledge can
also get entries in these companies.

 **Product Based Companies:** Now coming to the product based companies. These
companies have difficult hiring procedure, they choose those students or
working professionals who have strong command on Computer Fundamentals, Data
Structures, and algorithms. These companies are Microsoft, Google, Amazon,
Uber, Snapdeal, Zomato etc. Also, you should have strong logical and
analytical thinking. Most of the companies ignore the programming language
whatever you are using but still, you have to be well versed with at least one
programming language. They will check your problem-solving skill and coding.
They mostly choose the student from CS or IT background. But don’t worry if
you are not from IT background but having enough skill which these companies
require, you can still crack the interviews. These companies have generally
4-5 rounds. I would like to share some tips for cracking the interviews of
these companies.  
 **1\. Resume Building:** Your resume should clearly mention your
accomplishment, your command on computer fundamentals, your problem-solving
skill. It should be short and precise. Try to make connections with people
working in these companies, get a referral and apply for the job. Chances are
higher for the shortlisting if someone is referring you.  
 **2\. Problem Solving and Coding:** Once you get shortlisted you might have
to give telephonic round or face to face direct interview. It can be a
whiteboard interview or online test or on the paper. They will give you the
problems related to data structures and algorithms and you need to make the
program or solve the problem. Whenever an interviewer is giving the problem,
clear all the doubts and ask the questions. Like how many inputs are there or
if the question is related with array then sorted or unsorted anything. You
need the consider all the case scenarios.  
Now tell them your approach firstly using brute force algorithm. Once you are
done and the interviewer is convinced, write the program for that. Some
interviewers also try to help you while coding. They will be checking your
logical thinking and how clean and good code you are writing in less time.  
They can also ask to optimize your code or another best approach also they
will ask the question related with time and space complexity. They can also
give you a different scenario to break your code or algorithm, so make sure
you consider all the scenarios.  
 **3\. Projects:** Prepare yourself for whatever projects you have done during
your internship or in your employment career. You should have all the
knowledge about your project, which one was your favorite everything.  
 **4\. System Design:** Big companies like Amazon, Facebook have questions
related to system design. Like how would you create social media, messenger or
twitter. There you need to tell your approach step by step.  
 **5\. Cultural Fit:** Every company is looking for someone who can run their
business and make a profit, and that’s why this round is conducted in all the
companies. How would you deal with pressure, coordination with your co-workers
everything, they will check these things. If they won’t find you fit in their
culture, you will be rejected then, so make sure you don’t say anything
negative here.

In the end be nice and polite during your interview, do not fake anything,
smile, communicate properly, make eye contact to show your confidence and
never ever show your ego during your interviews. You can check
