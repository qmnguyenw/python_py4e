 **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** is one of the most important skills
that every computer science student must-have. It is often seen that people
with good knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others.

> Choosing the correct data structure or algorithm to solve a particular
> problem affects a lot on the efficiency of the solution.

These skills not only help a programmer to land a high-paying job but also to
sustain and perform well in the Job. **Let’s see how?**

_Consider the scenario of an interview, where two programmers **A** and **B**
applied for a software developer role and were asked to solve the below
problem._

  

  

**Problem** : Given a sorted array and a key to search. Check if the key is
present in the array or not.

**Programmer A** solves the above problem by performing a linear search
operation and **programmer B** solves the above problem by performing Binary
Search operation.

After the results are announced, _programmer B got selected_ and _programmer A
got rejected_.

**What went wrong with programmer A?**

The solutions of both of the programmers A and B were correct, but programmer
B is found to be efficient and more proficient in using the correct data
structure and algorithms to solve a particular problem given. The problem
mentioned above takes O(N) time by the solution of programmer A whereas it
takes O(LogN) time by the solution of programmer B.

With the increasing demands and competition in the software engineering
industry, companies these days not only look for hard-working developers but
also for developers who can solve a problem as optimally as possible to meet
customer satisfaction and are not afraid of paying high.

> Some surveys conducted about the salary reports of software developers in
> India says that anyone who has a good and fair understanding of how data
> structures and algorithms work earns around **20-30 Lakhs** per annum.
