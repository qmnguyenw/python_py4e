Implementation of DFS using adjacency matrix



Depth First Search (DFS) has been discussed in this article which uses
adjacency list for the graph representation. In this article, adjacency matrix
will be used to represent the graph.

 **Adjacency matrix representation:** In adjacency matrix representation of a
graph, the matrix **mat[][]** of size n*n (where n is the number of vertices)
will represent the edges of the graph where **mat[i][j] = 1** represents that
there is an edge between the vertices **i** and **j** while **mat[i][i] = 0**
represents that there is no edge between the vertices **i** and **j**.

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Approach:**

  

  

  * Create a matrix of size n*n where every element is 0 representing there is no edge in the graph.
  * Now, for every edge of the graph between the vertices i and j set mat[i][j] = 1.
  * After the adjacency matrix has been created and filled, call the recursive function for the source i.e. vertex 0 that will recursively call the same function for all the vertices adjacent to it.
  * Also, keep an array to keep track of the visited vertices i.e. visited[i] = true represents that vertex i has been been visited before and the DFS function for some already visited node need not be called.

Below is the implementation of the above approach:
