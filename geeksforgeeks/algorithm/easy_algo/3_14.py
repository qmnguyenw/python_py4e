Twisted Tower of Hanoi Problem



The basic version of the Tower of Hanoi can be found here.  
It is a twisted Tower of Hanoi problem. In which, all rules are the same with
an addition of a rule:  
 **You can not move any disk directly from the first rod to last rod** i.e.,
If you want to move a disk from the first rod to last rod then you have to
move the first rod to middle rod first and then to the last one.

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Approach:**

  *  **Base Case:** If the number of disk is 1, then move it to the middle rod first and then move it to the last rod.
  *  **Recursive Case:** In the recursive case following steps will produce the optimal solution:(All these moves are following the rules of twisted Tower of Hanoi problem)
    1. We will move first n-1 disks to the last rod first.
    2. Then move the largest disk to the middle rod.
    3. Move first n-1 disks from the last rod to the first rod.
    4. Move the largest disk at the middle rod to the last rod.
    5. Move all n-1 disks from the first rode to the last rod.

Below is the implementation of the above approach:

 **Output:**

    
    
    Move disk 1 from rod A to B and then to C
    Move disk 2 from rod A to B
    Move disk 1 from rod C to B and then to A
    Move disk 2 from rod B to C
    Move disk 1 from rod A to B and then to C
    

Recurrence formula:

    
    
    T(n) = T(n-1) + 1 + T(n-1) + 1 + T(n-1)
         = 3 * T(n-1) + 2
    
    where **n** is the number of disks.
    

By solving this recurrence the **Time Complexity will be O(3 n)**.
