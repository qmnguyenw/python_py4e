Find last remaining element after reducing the Array



Given an array **arr[]** of size **N** and an integer **K**. The task is to
find the last remaining element in the array after reducing the array. The
rules for reducing the array are:

  * The first and last element say X and Y are chosen and removed from the array arr[].
  * The values X and Y are added. Z = X + Y.
  * Insert the value of **Z % K** into the array arr[] at the position **((N/2) + 1) th** position, where N denotes the current length of the array.

Examples:

>  **Input:** N = 5, arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, K = 7  
>  **Output:** 1  
>  **Explanation:**  
>  The given array arr[] reduces as follows:  
> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -> {2, 6, 3, 4}  
> {2, 6, 3, 4} -> {6, 6, 3}  
> {6, 6, 3} -> {2, 6}  
> {2, 6} -> {1}  
> The last element of A is 1.
>
>  **Input:** N = 5, arr[] = {2, 4, 7, 11, 3}, K = 12  
>  **Output:** 3  
>  **Explanation:**  
>  The given array arr[] reduces as follows:  
> {2, 4, 7, 11, 3} -> {4, 5, 7, 11}  
> {4, 5, 7, 11} -> {5, 3, 7}  
> {5, 3, 7} -> {0, 3}  
> {0, 3} -> {3}  
> The last element of A is 3.

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Naive approach:** The naive approach for this problem is that at every
step, find the first element and last element in the array and compute **(X +
Y) % K** where X is the first element and Y is the last element of the array
at every step. After computing this value, insert this value at the given
position.

  

  

 **Time Complexity:** O(N2)

 **Efficient Approach:**

  * On observing carefully, it can be said that the sum of the elements of the array modulo K is never changed in the array throughout.
  * This is because we are basically inserting the value **X + Y % K** back into the array.
  * Therefore, this problem can be solved in linear time by directly finding the sum of the array and finding the value **sum % K**.
