Maximize big when both big and small can be exchanged



Given **N** Big Candies and **M** Small Candies. One Big Candy can be bought
by paying **X** small candies. Alternatively, one big candy can be sold for
**Y** small candies. The task is to find the maximum number of big candies
that can be bought.

 **Examples:**

>  **Input:** N = 3, M = 10, X = 4, Y = 2  
>  **Output:** 5  
> 8 small candies are exchanged for 2 big candies.
>
>  **Input:** N = 3, M = 10, X = 1, Y = 2  
>  **Output:** 16  
> Sell all the initial big candies to get 6 small candies.  
> Now 16 small candies can be exchanged for 16 big candies.

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

In first example, Big candies cannot be sold for profit. So, only the
remaining small candies can be exchanged for big candies.  
In second example, Big candies can be sold for profit.

  

  

 **Approach:** If initial big candies can be sold for profit i.e. **X < Y**
then sell the big candies and update the count of small and big candies. Then,
sell all of the updated small candies in order to buy big candies.

Below is the implementation of the above approach:

 int max_candies(int bigCandies, 

 int smallCandies,int X, int Y)

 {

 // If initial big candies 

 // can be sold for profit

 if (X < Y) 

 {

 smallCandies += Y * bigCandies;

 bigCandies = 0;

 }

 

 // Update big candies that can be bought

 bigCandies += (smallCandies / X);

 

 return bigCandies;

 }
