Interesting Examples of algorithms in everyday life



Ever found shortest path from Place A to Place B on Google Maps? Ever rolled a
dice just by a click in an online game? Ever used search functionality in a
website? One thing which is common to all these scenarios is that one or other
algorithm is being run and results are being delivered.

Simply stated, Algorithm is a set of instructions to reach a result based on
given inputs. To take a current world scenario, encryption has become almost a
minimum requirement for any application. For example, a popular encryption
technique is MD5 Encryption Algorithm.

Examples of MD5:

    
    
    Input : HelloWorld
    MD5 Hash : 68e109f0f40ca72a15e05cc22786f8e6
    
    Input : GeeksForGeeks
    MD5 Hash : f1e069787ece74531d112559945c6871
    

Google when showing search results uses page ranking techniques. Facebook when
showing news feed uses a similar ranking algorithm to make it more relevant to
you. All these use a modification of Link Analysis, an interesting branch in
Data Mining.  
Let’s consider a small example.  

![Network indicating friends](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-

Sample network graph with edges indicating friendships.

The above image shows a sample network graph in which each node represents a
different profile and an edge showing a friendship.Considering this scenario,
Facebook algorithms may determine that the number of mutual friends between A
and F is 2 and may update your feed and friend suggestions.

So, whenever you press a key on your keyboard, make a call, perform a
calculation, start an application or press a remote button, always an
algorithms is triggered. So, there are countless examples of many algorithms
in our daily life and making our life easier.
