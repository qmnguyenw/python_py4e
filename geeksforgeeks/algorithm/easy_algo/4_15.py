Find the number of elements greater than k in a sorted array



Given a sorted array **arr[]** of integers and an integer **k** , the task is
to find the count of elements in the array which are greater than **k**.
**Note** that **k** may or may not be present in the array.

 **Examples:**

>  **Input:** arr[] = {2, 3, 5, 6, 6, 9}, k = 6  
>  **Output:** 1
>
>  **Input:** arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 7}, k = 8  
>  **Output:** 0

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Approach:** The idea is to perform binary search and find the number of
elements greater than k.

{

 int l = 0;

 int r = n - 1;

 

 // Stores the index of the left most element

 // from the array which is greater than k

 int leftGreater = n;

 

 // Finds number of elements greater than k

 while (l <= r) {

 int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
