Sentinel Linear Search



Sentinel Linear Search as the name suggests is a type of Linear Search where
the number of comparisons are reduced as compared to a traditional linear
search. When a linear search is performed on an array of size N then in the
worst case a total of N comparisons are made when the element to be searched
is compared to all the elements of the array and (N + 1) comparisons are made
for the index of the element to be compared so that the index is not out of
bounds of the array which can be reduced in a Sentinel Linear Search.  
In this search, the last element of the array is replaced with the element to
be searched and then the linear search is performed on the array without
checking whether the current index is inside the index range of the array or
not because the element to be searched will definitely be found inside the
array even if it was not present in the original array since the last element
got replaced with it. So, the index to be checked will never be out of bounds
of the array. The number of comparisons in the worst case here will be (N +
2).  
 **Examples:**

> **Input:** arr[] = {10, 20, 180, 30, 60, 50, 110, 100, 70}, x = 180  
> **Output:** 180 is present at index 2  
>  **Input:** arr[] = {10, 20, 180, 30, 60, 50, 110, 100, 70}, x = 90  
> **Output:** Not found
