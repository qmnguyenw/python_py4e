How to solve problems that fall in the Finders keepers category in ‘Game
Theory’?

Note- Finders keepers game fall into the category of ‘Impartial Games’ in
‘Game Theory’.

 **What are ‘Impartial Games’?**

Let a game is being played between two players ‘A’ and ‘B’. A game between
them is said to be ‘Impartial’ if both the players have same set of moves.
Which move to choose at a particular moment of the game depends on the state
of the game.

 **FINDERS KEEPERS GAME**

  

  

> Let two players A and B playing a game on a pile of coins. Each player has
> to remove a minimum of ‘a’ coins or maximum of ‘b’ coins from the pile in
> his turn until there are less than ‘a’ coins left.

>  **Types:**
>
>   1.  **Finder-Winner** -> In this format the player to play the last move
> wins.
>   2.  **Keeper-Loser** -> In this format the player to play the last move
> loses.
>

 **STRATEGIES**

> Note- If there are less than ‘a’ coins available then last player to move
> must pick all coins.
>
>   1.  **FINDER-WINNER:** Let ‘A’ be the player to start. For a game of
> FINDER-WINNER the main strategy is to reduce the present number coins to a
> multiple (a+b) for ‘A’ to win the game. Else he loses and ‘B’ wins.
>   2.  **KEEPER-LOSER:** Let ‘A’ starts the game. For ‘A’ to win the game the
> main condition for winning it is to reduce the pile of coins to – (a+b)k +
> [1, a], i.e. the number of coins can be reduced to more then a multiple of
> (a+b) by [1 upto a]. If he can do so he wins else ‘B’ wins.

 **Examples:**

  1. Let **A** and **B** play a game of FINDER-WINNER on a set of **20 coins**. A player in his move can remove a **minimum of 5 coins** and a **maximum of 7 coins**. predict the Winner of the Game If **A** starts first and if both players play optimally.

> Given number of coins = 20.  
> Minimum coins that can be removed = 5 – Let it be ‘a’.  
> Maximum coins that can be removed = 7 – Let it be ‘b’.

 **According to given strategy for FINDER-WINNER:**

 _For **A to win**_ :
