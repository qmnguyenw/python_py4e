Interactive Problems in Competitive Programming



Interactive Problems are those problems in which our solution or code
interacts with the judge in real time. When we develop a solution for an
Interactive Problem then the input data given to our solution may not be
predetermined but is built for that problem specifically. The solution
performs a series of exchange of data with the judge and at the end of the
conversation the judge decides whether our solution was correct or not.  

## Guessing the Number (An Interactive Problem)

In this problem the user has to guess the number during a communication with
the judge. The user is provided with the upper and lower bound and he/she can
ask the judge whether a number is the number to be guessed. The judge replies
with -1 if the number is smaller than the number to be guessed or 1 if number
is greater than the number to be guessed or 0 if it is equal to the number to
be guessed.  

### Approach 1 : Linear Guessing  

The user can query the judge for all the numbers between lower limit and upper
limit to find the solution.

### Approach 2 : Applying Binary Search  

We can also apply binary search interactively to find the solution. This
solution is efficient as compared to the previous approach.
