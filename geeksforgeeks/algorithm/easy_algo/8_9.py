Mid-Point Circle Drawing Algorithm



The **mid-point** circle drawing algorithm is an algorithm used to determine
the points needed for rasterizing a circle.

We use the **mid-point** algorithm to calculate all the perimeter points of
the circle in the **first octant** and then print them along with their mirror
points in the other octants. This will work because a circle is symmetric
about itâ€™s centre.
