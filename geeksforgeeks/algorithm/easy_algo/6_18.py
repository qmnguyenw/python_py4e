Print array elements in alternatively increasing and decreasing order



Given an array of N elements. The task is to print the array elements in such
a way that first two elements are in increasing order, next 3 in decreasing
order, next 4 in increasing order and so on.

 **Examples** :

>  **Input** : arr = {2, 6, 2, 4, 0, 1, 4, 8, 2, 0, 0, 5}  
>  **Output** : 0 0 8 6 5 0 1 2 2 4 4 2 2 2
>
>  **Input** : arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  
>  **Output** : 1 2 6 5 4 3

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
