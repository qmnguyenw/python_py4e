Most important type of Algorithms



 ** _Algorithm:_ **  
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem. A good algorithm
should be optimized in terms of time and space. Different types of problems
require different types of algorithmic-techniques to be solved in the most
optimized manner. There are many types of algorithms but the most important
and the fundamental algorithms that you must know will be discussed in this
article.

 ** _Brute Force Algorithm:_ **  
This is the most basic and simplest type of algorithm. A Brute Force Algorithm
is the straightforward approach to a problem i.e., the first approach that
comes to our mind on seeing the problem. More technically it is just like
iterating every possibility available to solve that problem.

 **For Example:** If there is a lock of **4-digit** PIN. The digits to be
chosen from **0-9** then the brute force will be trying all possible
combinations one by one like **0001** , **0002** , **0003** , **0004** , and
so on until we get the right PIN. In the worst case, it will take **10,000
tries** to find the right combination.

 ** _Recursive Algorithm:_**  
This type of algorithm is based on recursion. In recursion, a problem is
solved by breaking it into subproblems of the same type and calling own self
again and again until the problem is solved with the help of a base condition.

Some common problem that is solved using recursive algorithms are Factorial of
a Number, Fibonacci Series, Tower of Hanoi, DFS for Graph, etc.

  

  

 ** _Divide and Conquer Algorithm:_**  
In Divide and Conquer algorithms, the idea is to solve the problem in two
sections, the first section divides the problem into subproblems of the same
type. The second section is to solve the smaller problem independently and
then add the combined result to produce the final answer to the problem.

Some common problem that is solved using Divide and Conquers Algorithms are
Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication, etc.

 ** _Dynamic Programming Algorithms:_**  
This type of algorithm is also known as the memoization technique because in
this the idea is to store the previously calculated result to avoid
calculating it again and again. In Dynamic Programming, divide the complex
problem into smaller overlapping subproblems and storing the result for future
use.

The following problems can be solved using Dynamic Programming algorithm
Knapsack Problem, Weighted Job Scheduling, Floyd Warshall Algorithm, Dijkstra
Shortest Path Algorithm, etc.

 ** _Greedy Algorithm:_**  
In the Greedy Algorithm, the solution is built part by part. The decision to
choose the next part is done on the basis that it gives the immediate benefit.
It never considers the choices that had taken previously.

Some common problems that can be solved through the Greedy Algorithm are
Prim’s Algorithm, Kruskal’s Algorithm, Huffman Coding, etc.

 ** _Backtracking Algorithm:_ **  
In Backtracking Algorithm, the problem is solved in an incremental way i.e. it
is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to
build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions
that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

Some common problems that can be solved through the Backtracking Algorithm are
Hamiltonian Cycle, M-Coloring Problem, N Queen Problem, Rat in Maze Problem,
etc.
