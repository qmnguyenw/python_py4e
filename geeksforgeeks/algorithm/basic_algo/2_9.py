Schedule elevator to reduce the total time taken



Given an integer **k** and an array **arr[]** representing the destination
floors for **N** people waiting currently at the ground floor and **k** is the
capacity of the elevator i.e. maximum number of people it can hold at the same
time. It takes 1 unit time for the elevator to reach any consecutive floor
from the current floor. The task is to schedule the elevator in a way to
minimize the total time taken to get all the people to their destination floor
and then return back to the ground floor.

 **Examples:**

>  **Input:** arr[] = {2, 3, 4}, k = 2  
>  **Output:** 12  
> Second and the third persons (destination floors 3 and 4) shall go in the
> first turn taking 8 (4 + 4) unit time. The only person left will take 2 unit
> time to get to the destination  
> And then the elevator will take another 2 unit time to get back to the
> ground floor.  
> Total time taken = 8 + 2 + 2 = 12
>
>  **Input:** arr[] = {5, 5, 4}, k = 3  
>  **Output:** 10  
> Every person can get on the elevator at the same time  
> Time required will be 10 (5 + 5).

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Approach:** Sort the given array in decreasing order of destination. Create
groups of K (starting from the highest floor), the cost for each group will be
**2 * (max(Elements in current group))**. The summation across all groups will
be the answer.

  

  

Below is the implementation of the above approach:

 sort(a, a + n, greater<int>());

 // Iterate through the groups

 for (int i = 0; i < n; i += k)

 

 // Update the time taken for each group
