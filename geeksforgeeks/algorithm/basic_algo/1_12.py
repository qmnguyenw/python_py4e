Array of Vectors in C++ STL



 **Prerequisite:** Arrays in C++, Vector in C++ STL

An **array** is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
It is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier
to get access to the elements stored in it by the position of each element.

 **Vectors** are known as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself
automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being
handled automatically by the container automatically.

Therefore, **array of vectors** is two dimensional array with fixed number of
rows where each row is vector of variable length. Each index of array stores a
vector which can be traversed and accessed using iterators.

 **Syntax:**

  

  

    
    
    vector <data_type> V[size];
    

**Example:**

    
    
    vector <int> A[5];
    where A is the array of vectors of int of size 5
    

_**Insertion:**_ Insertion in array of vectors is done using **push_back()**
function.

 **For Example:**

    
    
    for i in [0, n) {
      A[i].push_back(35)
    }
    

Above pseudo-code inserts element 35 at every index of **vector <int> A[n]**.

 _ **Traversal:**_ Traversal in an array of vectors is perform using
iterators.

 **For Example:**

    
    
    for i in [0, n) {
       for(iterator it = A[i].begin(); 
           it!=A[i].end(); it++) {
          print(*it)
        }
    }
    

Above pseudo-code traverses **vector <int> A[n]** at each index using starting
iterators **A[i].begin()** and ending iterator **A[i].end()**. For accessing
the element it uses **(*it)** as iterators are pointers pointing to elements
in **vector <int> A[n]**.

Below is the program to illustrate the insertion in the array of vectors.
