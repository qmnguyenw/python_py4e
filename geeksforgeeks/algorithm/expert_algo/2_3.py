Advanced Quick Sort (Hybrid Algorithm)



 **Prerequisites:** Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort

In this article, a Hybrid algorithm with the combination of quick sort and
insertion sort is implemented. As the name suggests, the Hybrid algorithm
combines more than one algorithm.

 **Why Hybrid algorithm:**  
Quicksort algorithm is efficient if the size of the input is very large. But,
insertion sort is more efficient than quick sort in case of small arrays as
the number of comparisons and swaps are less compared to quicksort. So we
combine the two algorithms to sort efficiently using both approaches.

 **Note:** Selectionsort algorithm can also be used to combine with quicksort.
Though the time complexity is of O(N2), these algorithms prove to be efficient
in this case because these are used only when the size of the array is less
than a threshold value( **10** in this article).

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Dry run of the algorithm:**

  

  

> Let arr[] = {24, 97, 40, 67, 88, 85, 15, 66, 53, 44, 26, 48, 16, 52, 45, 23,
> 90, 18, 49, 80}

 **Approach:** The idea is to use recursion and continuously find the size of
the array. If the size is greater than the threshold value(10), then the
quicksort function is called for that portion of the array. Else, insertion
sort is called.
