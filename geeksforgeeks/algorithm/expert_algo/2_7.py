Count of interesting primes upto N



Given a number **N** , the task is to find the number of interesting primes
less than equal to **N**.

An **interesting prime** is any prime number which can be written as **a 2 \+
b4**, where **a** and **b** are positive integers. For e.g. The smallest
interesting prime number is **2 = 1 2 \+ 14**.

 **Examples:**

>  **Input:** N = 10  
>  **Output:** 2  
> 2 = 12 \+ 14  
> 5 = 22 \+ 14  
> Both are interesting primes less than equal to 10
>
>  **Input:** N = 1000  
>  **Output:** 28

 **Naive Approach:**

  1. Iterate through all numbers from **1** to **N**
