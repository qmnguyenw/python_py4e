Program for Best Fit algorithm in Memory Management using Linked List



 **Best fit algorithm for memory management:** The memory partition in which
there is a minimum loss on the allocation of the process is the best-fit
memory partition that is allocated to the process.

We have already discussed one best-fit algorithm using arrays in this article.
However, here we are going to look into another approach using a linked list
where the deletion of allocated nodes is also possible.

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input :** blockSize[] = {100, 500, 200}
            processSize[] = {95, 417, 112, 426} 
    **Output :**
    Block with size 426 can't be allocated
    Tag    Block ID    Size
    0          0        95
    1          1        417
    2          2        112
    After deleting node with tag id 1.
    Tag    Block ID    Size
    0        0         95
    2        2        112
    3        1        426

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Approach:** The idea is to assign a unique tag id to each memory block.
Each process of different sizes are given block id, which signifies to which
memory block they belong to, and unique tag id to delete particular process to
free up space. Create a free list of given memory block sizes and allocated
list of processes.

  

  

 **Create allocated list:**  
Create an allocated list of given process sizes by finding the most
appropriate or best memory block to allocate memory from. If the memory block
is not found, then simply print it. Otherwise, create a node and add it to the
allocated linked list.

 **Delete process:**  
Each process is given a unique tag id. Delete the process node from the
allocated linked list to free up some space for other processes. After
deleting, use the block id of the deleted node to increase the memory block
size in the free list.

Below is the implementation of the approach:
