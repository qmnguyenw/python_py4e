Why companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google focuses on Data Structures and
Algorithms : Answered



It’s Summertime and the placement season is in full swing! There are many
product-based companies that recruit during this time like Adobe, Amazon,
Microsoft, Google, etc. However, most of the interviews for technical roles in
these companies are focused on measuring the **Data Structures and
Algorithms** knowledge of the candidates.

Software Product Based Companies normally create products that are related to
software. So it stands to reason that they require quality **Software
Developers** to handle the development process for the software. The pay-scale
of Software Developers has increased a lot in recent times globally. According
to the report by glassdoor, the average base pay of Software Developers in
India is found to be around **10 Lakhs _per annum_**. The average base of
software developers ranges from **Rs. 365,000** to **Rs 1,709,000** per year.
(With Product Based Companies occupying the higher end of the spectrum)

However, there is an acute shortage of well-qualified Software developers in
India. According to the National Employability Report by **Aspiring Minds** ,
only **3.84%** of engineers are employable in software-related jobs at
startups. That is where Data Structures and Algorithms come in. They are so
important in Product Based Companies interviews as they are the hallmark of
any good Software Developer.

  

  

In addition to that, there are multiple reasons why **Product Based
Companies** place so much emphasis on Data Structures and Algorithms as stated
below:

  1. Data Structures and Algorithms demonstrate the **problem-solving ability** of a candidate. There is no room to craft elaborate stories and this means that either the candidate can solve the problem or they can’t.
  2. Questions based on Data Structures and Algorithms can be **scaled up or down** according to the knowledge level of the candidate. This means that a variety of candidates can be tested using roughly the same problems.
  3. Data Structures and Algorithms are used to test the **analytical skills** of the candidates as they are a useful tool to pick out the underlying algorithms in real-world problems and solve them efficiently.
  4. Data Structures and Algorithms are the **fundamentals** of Software Development. They remain the same no matter what new technology is used and that puts the focus on the problem rather than the technology in the interview process.

### Learning Data Structures and Algorithms

Now that we have established that Data Structures and Algorithms are important
for interviews in **Product Based Companies** , let’s focus on learning them.

> Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data
> structures and their relationships.

While learning Data Structures and Algorithms, it is best to start small with
simpler topics and then move on to more and more complex topics. Some of the
basic data structures are **Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues,** etc. while
some of the basic algorithms are **Sorting, Searching,** etc.

Some of the major problems that can appear while learning Data Structures and
Algorithms are:

  *  **Lack of guidance**  
There is no clear guidance while learning Data Structures and Algorithms.
There are numerous topics within these umbrella terms with no specific
guidelines about which topics would be more useful for different Product Based
Companies. This situation can be quite confusing, especially for a beginner.

  *  **No idea from where to start learning**  
Even if the necessary topics in Data Structures and Algorithms are known, the
sheer amount of them leads to a lot of confusion. Most beginners have no idea
from where to start learning or even what chronological order to follow while
learning.

To solve the above problems, we at GeeksforGeeks have designed a number of
online courses to learn Data Structures and Algorithms at affordable prices.
One of the latest course created by us is named **Placement 100**. The prefix
“100” in the name of the course indicates that this course aims to get you
**100%** placement ready. This course covers Data Structures and Algorithms
along with other subjects in order to completely prepare you for placements in
product-based companies. Placement 100 is a 6 months program comprising of an
online course, assessment exam and placement assistance for top performers.

### Placement 100 Course

 **Placement 100** is an online course that covers all the topics required to
prepare for placements. The course includes **theory & lecture videos **for
improvised learning supported by **tracks & contests** for practice. It comes
with a first-in-industry feature: **Doubt Assistance** to help you if you are
stuck. The course will be followed by mock tests which will prepare you for
the assessment exam. The **assessment exam** will be based on the whole course
and will be similar to screening exams conducted by most companies. The top
performers in the assessment exam will be prioritized in the placement program
by GeeksforGeeks. The program also includes **Mock Interviews** after the
assessment exam for the selected students and _**referrals for the top
performers**_ to direct interview in some companies.
