Count possible combinations of pairs with adjacent elements from first N
numbers



Given a number N, the task is to count all possible combinations of pairs
formed using adjacent elements.

 **Note** : If an element exists already in a pair, it cannot be picked in the
next pair. For example: for {1,2,3}: {1,2} and {2,3} will not be considered as
a correct combination.

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input :** N = 4
    **Output :** 5
    **Explanation :** If N = 4, the possible combinations are:
    {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}
    {1, 2}, {3, 4}
    {1}, {2, 3}, {4}
    {1}, {2}, {3, 4}
    {1, 2}, {3}, {4}
    
    **Input :** N = 5
    **Output :** 8
    

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Approach :** Break the problem into smaller subproblems. If there are N
numbers, and there are two cases either a number is alone, or it is in a pair,
if a number is alone, find the ways of pairing (n-1) numbers left, or if it is
in a pair, find the ways of pairing (n-2) numbers left. If there are just 2
numbers left they can generate 2 combinations either alone or in a pair, and
if a single number is left it will be in singleton, so there is just 1
combination.

Below is the implementation of the above approach:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

// Function to count the number of ways

int ways(int n)

{

 // If there is a single number left 

 // it will form singleton

 if (n == 1) {

 return 1;

 }

 // if there are just 2 numbers left, 

 // they will form a pair

 if (n == 2) {

 return 2;

 }

 else {

 return ways(n - 1) + ways(n - 2);

 }

}

 

// Driver Code

int main()

{

 int n = 5;

 

 cout << "Number of ways = " << ways(n);

 

 return 0;

}
