Flood Fill Algorithm



Given a 2D screen **arr[][]** where each **arr[i][j]** is an integer
representing the colour of that pixel, also given the location of a pixel
**(X, Y)** and a colour **C** , the task is to replace the colour of the given
pixel and all the adjacent same-coloured pixels with the given colour.

 **Example:**

>  **Input:** arr[][] = {  
> {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1},  
> {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},  
> {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1},  
> {1, **2, 2, 2, 2,** 0, 1, 0},  
> {1, 1, 1, **2, 2,** 0, 1, 0},  
> {1, 1, 1, **2, 2, 2, 2,** 0},  
> {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, **2,** 1, 1},  
> {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, **2, 2,** 1}}  
> X = 4, Y = 4, C = 3  
>  **Output:**  
>  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  
> 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0  
> 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1  
> 1 **3 3 3 3** 0 1 0  
> 1 1 1 **3 3** 0 1 0  
> 1 1 1 **3 3 3 3** 0  
> 1 1 1 1 1 **3** 1 1  
> 1 1 1 1 1 **3 3** 1  
>  **Explanation:**  
>  The values in the given 2D screen indicate colours of the pixels. X and Y
> are coordinates of the brush, C is the colour that should replace the
> previous colour on screen[X][Y] and all surrounding pixels with the same
> colour. Hence all the 2 are replaced with 3.

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **BFS Approach:** The idea is to use BFS traversal to replace the colour with
the new colour.

  * Create an empty queue lets say _Q_.
  * Push the starting location of the pixel as given in the input and apply replacement colour to it.
  * Iterate until **Q** is not empty and pop the front node (pixel position).
  * Check the pixels adjacent to the current pixel and push into the queue if valid (had not been coloured with replacement colour and have the same colour as the old colour).

Fill algorithm as well.
