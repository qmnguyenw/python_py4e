Maximum sub-array sum after dividing array into sub-arrays based on the given
queries



Given an array **arr[]** and an integer **k** , we can cut this array at **k**
different positions where **k[]** stores the positions of all the cuts
required. The task is to print maximum sum among all the cuts after every cut
made.  
Every cut is of the form of an integer **x** where **x** denotes a cut between
**arr[x]** and **arr[x + 1]**.

 **Examples:**

>  **Input:** arr[] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, k[] = {0, 2, 3, 1}  
>  **Output:**  
>  26  
> 15  
> 11  
> 8  
>  **First cut - >** {4} and {5, 6, 7, 8}. Maximum possible sum is 5 + 6 + 7 +
> 8 = 26  
>  **Second cut - >** {4}, {5, 6} and {7, 8}. Maximum sum = 15  
>  **Third cut - >** {4}, {5, 6}, {7} and {8}. Maximum sum = 11  
>  **Fourth cut - >** {4}, {5}, {6}, {7} and {8}. Maximum sum = 8
>
>  **Input:** arr[] = {1, 2, 3}, k[] = {1}  
>  **Output:**  
>  3

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Naive approach:** Store the resulting pieces of the array in an ArrayList
and after every cut compute linearly the maximum possible sum. But this method
would require **O(n*k)** time to answer all the queries.

  

  

 **Efficient approach:** We can represent each resulting piece of the array as
a Piece object with data members **start** (start index of this piece),
**end** (end index of this piece) and **value** (sum value of this piece). We
can store these pieces in a TreeSet and **sort them by their sum values**.
Therefore, after every cut we can get the Piece with largest sum value in
O(log(n)).

  * We have to make a prefix sum array of the array values to get the sum between two indices in constant time.
  * We have to maintain another TreeSet with start indexes of all the current pieces so that we can find the exact piece to cut. For example, for a single piece:
    1. {1, 8} -> start = 1, end = 2, value = 9 and {6, 3, 9} -> start = 3, end = 5, value = 18.
    2. In order to cut index 4, we need to cut the second piece into two pieces as {6, 3} ans {9}. So we get the start index of which piece to cut from this TreeSet.
