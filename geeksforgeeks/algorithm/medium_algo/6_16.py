Live Classes for Data Structures and Algorithms: Interview Preparation Focused
Course



Engineers have the power to change the world by solving real-world problems
but underneath its DSA that plays a crucial role in solving all the problems
we are surrounded with. These all are the reasons people from all age groups
love to move towards programming and want to learn it. Also, all the major
tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, etc..) are looking for
someone who can have this skill to solve these problems.

Now the question is if you are one of them who is really interested in
learning this skill then how can you learn all the building blocks of DSA?.
Who is going to teach you and guide you face to face? How would you ask your
doubts? How would you practice? how everything can get done from a single
resource? You may get certain resources to learn everything but most probably
it’s not possible without going anywhere, it’s not possible sitting at your
home and attending the class as you have been learning during your school time
or in a traditional classroom program.![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-
