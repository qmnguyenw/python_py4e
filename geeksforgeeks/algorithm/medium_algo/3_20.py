Minimum concatenation required to get strictly LIS for the given array



Given an **array A[]** of size n where there are only unique elements in the
array. We have to find the minimum concatenation required for sequence A to
get strictly Longest Increasing Subsequence. For array A[] we follow 1 based
indexing.

 **Examples:**

>  **Input:** A = {1, 3, 2}  
> **Output:** 2  
> **Explanation:**  
> We can concatenate A two times as [1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2] and then output for
> index 1, 3, 5 which gives sub-sequence as 1->2->3.  
>  **Input:** A = {2, 1, 4, 3, 5}  
> **Output:** 3  
> **Explanation:**  
> The given array has to be concatenated 3 times to generate the Longest
> Increasing Subsequence.

Recommended: Please try your approach on _**_{IDE}_**_ first, before moving on
to the solution.

 **Approach:**  
To solve the problem mentioned above the very first observation is that a
strictly increasing sub-sequence will always have its length equal to the
number of unique elements present in sequence A[]. Hence, we have to figure
out a way to keep the maximum consecutive numbers in order are together. We
can achieve this by taking as many strictly consecutive numbers in a sequence
before opting for concatenation and handle others in the next concatenation.

  * Form pairs of elements and its index and store them in sorted order as per value. Initialize a variable to count the required concatenation operations.
  * Run a loop from index 2 to n and if index of pair[i-1] > pair[i] then increment the variable by 1 which was counting the required concatenation operations, otherwise continue the process.

Below is the implementation of the above approach:
