Find intersection of intervals given by two lists



Given two **2-D arrays** which represent intervals. Each 2-D array represents
a list of intervals. Each list of intervals is **disjoint** and sorted in
increasing order. Find the intersection or set of ranges that are common to
both the lists.

> Disjoint means no element is common in a list. Example: {1, 4} and {5, 6}
> are disjoint while {1, 4} and {2, 5} are not as 2, 3 and 4 are common to
> both intervals.

**Examples:**

> **Input:** arr1[][] = {{0, 4}, {5, 10}, {13, 20}, {24, 25}}  
> arr2[][] = {{1, 5}, {8, 12}, {15, 24}, {25, 26}}  
> **Output:** {{1, 4}, {5, 5}, {8, 10}, {15, 20}, {24, 24}, {25, 25}}  
>  **Explanation:**  
>  {1, 4} lies completely within range {0, 4} and {1, 5}. Hence, {1, 4} is the
> desired intersection. Similarly, {24, 24} lies completely within two
> intervals {24, 25} and {15, 24}.
>
>  **Input:** arr1[][] = {{0, 2}, {5, 10}, {12, 22}, {24, 25}}  
> arr2[][] = {{1, 4}, {9, 12}, {15, 24}, {25, 26}}  
> **Output:** {{1, 2}, {9, 10}, {12, 12}, {15, 22}, {24, 24}, {25, 25}}  
> **Explanation:**  
> {1, 2} lies completely within range {0, 2} and {1, 4}. Hence, {1, 2} is the
> desired intersection. Similarly, {12, 12} lies completely within two
> intervals {12, 22} and {9, 12}.

to the solution.

 **Approach:**  
To solve the problem mentioned above, two pointer technique can be used, as
per the steps given below:

  * Maintain **two pointers** i and j to traverse the two interval lists, arr1 and arr2 respectively.
  * Now, if arr1[i] has smallest endpoint, it can only intersect with arr2[j]. Similarly, if arr2[j] has smallest endpoint, it can only intersect with arr1[i]. If intersection occurs, find the intersecting segment.
  * [l, r] will be the intersecting segment iff l <= r, where **l = max(arr1[i][0], arr2[j][0])** and **r = min(arr1[i][1], arr2[j][1])**.
  * Increment the i and j pointers accordingly to move ahead.

Below is the implementation of the approach:
