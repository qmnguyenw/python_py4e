Tkinter Application to Switch Between Different Page Frames



 **Prerequisites:** Python GUI â€“ tkinter  

Sometimes it happens that we need to create an application with several pops
up dialog boxes, i.e Page Frames. Here is a step by step process to create
multiple Tkinter Page Frames and link them! This can be used as a boilerplate
for more complex python GUI applications like creating interfaces for Virtual
Laboratories for experiments, classrooms, etc.  

Here are the steps:

  * Create three different pages. Here we have three different pages, The start page as the home page, page one, and page two. 
  * Create a container for each page frame. 
  * We have four classes. First is the tkinterApp class, where we have initialized the three frames and defined a function show_frame which is called every time the user clicks on a button. 
  * The StartPage is simple with two buttons to go to Page 1 and Page 2. 
  * Page 1 has two buttons, One for Page 2 and another to return to Start Page. 
  * Page 2 also has two buttons, one for Page 1 and others to return to StartPage. 
  * This is a simplistic application of navigating between Tkinter frames. 
  * This can be used as a boilerplate for more complex applications and several features can be added.   

The App starts with the StartPage as the first page, as shown in class
tkinterApp. Here in StartApp, there are two buttons. Clicking on a button
takes you to the respective Page. You can add images and graphs to these pages
and add complex functionality. The pages have two buttons as well. Every time
a button is pressed show_frame is called, which displays the respective Page.  
Below is the implementation.
