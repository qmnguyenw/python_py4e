How to Become a Data Analyst in 2019: A Complete Guide



 **In modern times, data holds all the answers but the main thing is asking
the right questions!!!**

And this is the job of the Data Analyst. In fact, the Data Analyst is the one
who must turn the data into information and the information into insights. And
these insights are then used by the companies in many ways ranging from
forming marketing strategies to making improvements in the production process.  
In other words, being a Data Analyst is an extremely important job in the
current data age. They process the almost infinite amounts of data and then
refine and process it to obtain some actionable insights that are useful for
the decision-makers in the company. And the main thing is that these jobs are
**Very Highly Paid** because of an increase in demand and low supply. In fact,
there are currently **97,000** analytics and data science positions vacant in
India due to a dearth of qualified candidates.

And that is the reason this article is a complete guide to becoming a Data
Analyst in 2019. This is a roadmap that you can follow if you are interested
in learning more about Data Analytics.

But there is still a lot of confusion between the differences in the role of a
Data Analyst and a Data Scientist so we’ll start our article with that and
move on to other topics like the Education Requirements and Skill Requirements
to Become a Data Analyst.

  

  

### What is the Difference Between a Data Analyst and a Data Scientist?

It’s obvious that both a Data Analyst and Data Scientist have a job
description related to data. But what?!! That’s a question that many people
have regarding the differences between a Data Analyst and Data Scientist. So
let’s clear this doubt here!

A **Data Analyst** uses the data to solve various problems and obtain
actionable insights for the company. This is done by using various tools on
well-defined data sets to answer corporate questions like “ _Why is a
marketing campaign more effective in certain regions?_ ” or “ _Why have
product sales reduced in the current quarter?_ ” and so on. For this, the
basic skills that a Data Analyst possesses are **Data Mining, R,SQL,
Statistical Analysis, Data Analysis**, etc. In fact, many Data Analysts gain
the extra skills required and become Data Scientists.

A **Data Scientist** , on the other hand, can design new processes and
algorithms for data modeling, create predictive models and perform custom
analysis on the data according to company requirements. So the main difference
is that a Data Scientist can utilize heavy coding to designing data modeling
processes rather than using the pre-existing ones to obtain answers from the
data like a Data Analyst. For this, the basic skills that a Data Scientist
possesses are **Data Mining, R,SQL, Machine Learning, Hadoop, Statistical
Analysis, Data Analysis, OOPS**, etc. So the reason that Data Scientists are
more heavily paid than Data Analysts is their high skill levels coupled with
high demand and low supply!

### Education Requirements to Become a Data Analyst

There are many paths to reach your goal as a Data Analyst and you can follow
any of them! But keep in mind that most of these paths pass through a college
as a four-year bachelor’s degree is the minimum requirement (Masters and Ph.D.
certainly don’t hurt!!!)  
You can either complete a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science as that will
obviously teach you the skills required to collect, analyze and interpret
large amounts of data. You will learn all about _statistics, analysis
techniques, programming languages_ , etc. that will only help in your job as a
Data Analyst.

Another way is that you can complete any technical degree that will help in
your role as a Data Analyst like **Computer science, Statistics, Mathematics,
Economics** , etc. After completing your degree you can do Masters in
**Business Analytics, Big Data, Data Science** , etc. as they all will
contribute towards a job in Data Analytics. Or you can even do an internship
after Bachelor’s that will provide you with the practical experience you need.

### Skill Requirements to Become a Data Analyst

As a Data Analyst, your skills are the tools you need to find the needle in
the data haystack! And so there are multiple skills that you need ranging
across different fields. Most of them are mentioned below:

 **1\. Data Analytical Skills:** As a Data Analyst, you should obviously have
Data Analytical Skills or what’s the point!!! This is the ability to analyze
and interpret large amounts of data and produce actionable insights for your
company. So you should be familiar with at least the basics of Statistical
Analysis and the knowledge of when to use which statistical techniques for a
given data problem. Also, there are many analytical tools that are immensely
helpful in Statistical Analysis as a Data Analyst. The most popular of these
are SAS, Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Pig, etc. so it’s important that you have a
thorough knowledge of them.

 **2\. SQL:** Data plays a big part in the life of a Data Analyst
(Obviously!). And so you need to be proficient in SQL as that is one of the
primary tools for Data Management which involves _Data Extraction,
Transformation, and Loading_. This means that you have to extract the data
from various sources, then transform it in the required format for analysis
and finally load it into a data warehouse. A Data Analyst also needs SQL to
run queries in order to find relevant trends in the current data and for data
processing that might be of use for a Data Scientist.

 **3\. Advanced Microsoft Excel:** You might think that Microsoft Excel is
just a spreadsheet, but actually its a very important part of Data Analysis.
Even though Excel might not be very useful for big data analytics like R or
Python, it is a godsend for smaller analytics with tools like _VBA methods_.
Over the years, Excel has remained hugely relevant in Data Analytics, so make
sure to learn as much about the many functions available if you want to
succeed in your career choice!

 **4.R or Python: **Programming Skills are a necessary tool in your arsenal as
a Data Analyst! They are essential in performing predictive analytics on big
data sets in order to draw useful conclusions. In general, Python and R are
the most commonly used languages for this purpose. Python is used because of
its capacity for statistical analysis and its easy readability but purely
statistically, R is a little more popular as it was created specifically for
data analytics.

 **5\. Communication Skills:** You must be great at Communication Skills as
well in order to become an expert Data Analyst! That’s because while you
understand the data better than anyone else, you need to translate your data
findings into quantified insights for a non-technical team to aide in the
decision making. This can also involve _data storytelling_! So you should be
able to present your data in a storytelling format with concrete results and
values so that other people can understand what you are saying.
