Kâ€™th Non-repeating Character in Python using List Comprehension and
OrderedDict



Given a string and a number k, find the k-th non-repeating character in the
string. Consider a large input string with lacs of characters and a small
character set. How to find the character by only doing only one traversal of
input string?

Examples:

    
    
    Input : str = geeksforgeeks, k = 3
    Output : r
    First non-repeating character is f,
    second is o and third is r.
    
    Input : str = geeksforgeeks, k = 2
    Output : o
    
    Input : str = geeksforgeeks, k = 4
    Output : Less than k non-repeating
             characters in input.

# Function to find k'th non repeating character

# in string 

from collections import OrderedDict 

 

def kthRepeating(input,k): 

 

 # OrderedDict returns a dictionary data 

 # structure having characters of input 

 # string as keys in the same order they 

 # were inserted and 0 as their default value 

 dict=OrderedDict.fromkeys(input,0) 

 

 # now traverse input string to calculate 

 # frequency of each character 

 for ch in input: 

 dict[ch]+=1

 

 # now extract list of all keys whose value 

 # is 1 from dict Ordered Dictionary 

 nonRepeatDict = [key for (key,value) in dict.items() if
value==1] 

 

 # now return (k-1)th character from above list 

 if len(nonRepeatDict) < k: 

 return 'Less than k non-repeating characters in input.'

 else: 

 return nonRepeatDict[k-1]
