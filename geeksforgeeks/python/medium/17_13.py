Python | Create simple animation for console-based application



As we know Python is a scripting language, and can be easily used to automate
simple tasks. In this article, we will learn how to create a simple console-
based animation, which can be used while developing a console based project as
a utility.

We will try to replicate the loading animation as shown below:

We will be using following modules â€“  
 **

    
    
    sys module
    os module
    time module

**  
  
Below is the Python implementation:

# importing the necessary packages

import time

import sys

import os

 

# Function for implementing the loading animation

def load_animation():

 

 # String to be displayed when the application is loading

 load_str = "starting your console application..."

 ls_len = len(load_str)

 

 

 # String for creating the rotating line

 animation = "|/-\\"

 anicount = 0

 

 # used to keep the track of

 # the duration of animation

 counttime = 0

 

 # pointer for travelling the loading string

 i = 0

 

 while (counttime != 100):

 

 # used to change the animation speed

 # smaller the value, faster will be the animation

 time.sleep(0.075) 

 

 # converting the string to list

 # as string is immutable

 load_str_list = list(load_str) 

 

 # x->obtaining the ASCII code

 x = ord(load_str_list[i])

 

 # y->for storing altered ASCII code

 y = 0

 

 # if the character is "." or " ", keep it unaltered

 # switch uppercase to lowercase and vice-versa 

 if x != 32 and x != 46: 

 if x>90:

 y = x-32

 else:

 y = x + 32

 load_str_list[i]= chr(y)

 

 # for storing the resultant string

 res ='' 

 for j in range(ls_len):

 res = res + load_str_list[j]

 

 # displaying the resultant string

 sys.stdout.write("\r"+res + animation[anicount])

 sys.stdout.flush()

 

 # Assigning loading string

 # to the resultant string

 load_str = res

 

 

 anicount = (anicount + 1)% 4

 i =(i + 1)% ls_len

 counttime = counttime + 1

 

 # for windows OS

 if os.name =="nt":

 os.system("cls")

 

 # for linux / Mac OS

 else:

 os.system("clear")

 

# Driver program

if __name__ == '__main__': 

 load_animation()

 

 # Your desired code continues from here 

 # s = input("Enter your name: ")

 s ="David"

 sys.stdout.write("Hello "+str(s)+"\n")
