Python | Create and write on excel file using xlsxwriter module



 **XlsxWriter** is a Python module for writing files in the XLSX file
format. It can be used to write text, numbers, and formulas to multiple
worksheets. Also, it supports features such as formatting, images, charts,
page setup, auto filters, conditional formatting and many others.

Use this command to install xlsxwriter module:

    
    
     pip install xlsxwriter 

  
**Note:** Throughout XlsxWriter, rows and columns are zero indexed. The first
cell in a worksheet, A1 is (0, 0), B1 is (0, 1), A2 is (1, 0), B2 is (1, 1)
..similarly for all.

Letâ€™s see how to create and write to an excel-sheet using Python.

 **Code #1 :** Using A1 notation(cell name) for writing data in the specific
cells.

# import xlsxwriter module

import xlsxwriter

 

# Workbook() takes one, non-optional, argument 

# which is the filename that we want to create.

workbook = xlsxwriter.Workbook('hello.xlsx')

 

# The workbook object is then used to add new 

# worksheet via the add_worksheet() method.

worksheet = workbook.add_worksheet()

 

# Use the worksheet object to write

# data via the write() method.

worksheet.write('A1', 'Hello..')

worksheet.write('B1', 'Geeks')

worksheet.write('C1', 'For')

worksheet.write('D1', 'Geeks')

 

# Finally, close the Excel file

# via the close() method.

workbook.close()

XlsxWriter has some advantages and disadvantages over the alternative Python
modules for writing Excel files.

 **Advantages:**

  * It supports more Excel features than any of the alternative modules.
  * It has a high degree of fidelity with files produced by Excel. In most cases the files produced are 100% equivalent to files produced by Excel.
  * It has extensive documentation, example files and tests.
  * It is fast and can be configured to use very little memory even for very large output files.

 **Disadvantages:**

  * It cannot read or modify existing Excel XLSX files.
