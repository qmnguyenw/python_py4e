Before moving further, let’s have a brief introduction to **Python** Language.
Python, designed by _Guido Van Rossum_ in 1991, is a **general-purpose
programming language**. The language is widely used in _Web Development_ ,
_Data Science_ , _Machine Learning_ , and various other trending domains in
the tech world. Moreover, Python supports multiple programming paradigms and
has a huge set of libraries and tools. Also, the language offers various other
key features such as _better code readability_ , _vast community support_ ,
_fewer lines of code_ , and many more. Here in this article, we’ll discuss a
_**thorough curriculum or roadmap that you need to follow to learn Python in
just 21 days!**_

### 1\. Understand the Basics (Day: 1)

This is the first and foremost task you need to do – _**To understand the
nature & basics of Python Language**_! You’re required to go through the deep
_introduction_ , _features & applications_ of the language. Meanwhile, you’re
also required to **know about the installation process & setting up the path**
to run Python Programs. You are also recommended to **create your first basic
Python Program** that will help you to get familiar with the syntax &
execution process of the Python Program. Moreover, you can explore some
_Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)_ also such as Pycharm, Jupyter,
and various others.

  * Hello World Program in Python
  * Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for Python

### 2\. Learn Python DataTypes, Variables & Operators (Day: 2-3)

Now, you need to take a step forward and know about the foundational elements
of Python Language – _**Variables, Datatypes & Operators**_. Although when it
comes to Python Variables, you don’t need to declare variables before using
them as Python is a **Dynamically-Typed Programming Language**. Moreover,
you’re required to go through various **built-in Datatypes in Python** such as
_Numeric_ , _Boolean_ , _Sequence Type_ , etc. Also, you can explore Operators
in Python and can practice a few basic programs as well on these topics for
more clarification of the concepts.

  * Data Types | Variables in Python
  * Global and Local Variables in Python
  * Operators in Python

  * Python Programming Examples for Practice

### 3\. Learn Conditional & Flow Control Statements in Python (Day: 4-5)

After going through the Python Fundamentals, Variables, Operators, etc., now
you need to _**understand the conditionals and control flow statements**_ in
Python Programming. The Python Program Flow Control concerns with various
topics such as _For Loop_ , _While Loop_ , _Do-While Loop_ , etc. Meanwhile,
the Conditional Statements concerns with several concepts such as _If_ , _If-
else_ , _Nested if-else_ , etc. You’re required to cover these topics in-depth
and also recommended to solve several programming questions relevant to these
topics. Several other topics such as Control Statements like **Break** ,
**Continue** , **Pass** , etc. can also be taken into consideration.

  

  

  * Decision-Making statements in Python
  * Loops in Python
  * Looping Techniques in Python
  * Control Statements in Python
  * Chaining Comparison in Python

### 4\. Understand String, List & Dictionary Manipulations in Python (Day:
6-7)

Once you’ll get done with the above-mentioned topics, now you’re required to
_**understand the String, List & Dictionary Manipulations**_ in Python
Langauge. In general, the Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of
items where each item holds a **key/value** pair. Moreover, String in Python
is an array of bytes representing Unicode characters, and List in Python
represents a mutable data structure that concerns with an ordered sequence of
elements. Also, you’re recommended to go through several other topics as well
such as _**Tuple**_ , _**Sets**_ , etc.

  * Python Arrays
  * Python Dictionary
  * Python String | Python Lists 
  * Byte Objects vs String in Python
  * Python Sets | Python Tuples

### 5\. Get Familiar With Python Functions & Modules (Day: 8-10)

Furthermore, you need to understand one of the most crucial parts of Python
Programming – _**Functions & Modules in Python**_. You’re required to learn
various aspects of Python Functions such as types of functions, how to write &
call a function, function with arguments, etc. Moreover, you’re also required
to learn about Module in Python which is a file that contains Python
definitions and statements. Also, you need to need to know about several other
topics such as **Python Closures** , **Packages** , **Lambda functions** , and
various others.
