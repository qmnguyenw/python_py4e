12 Reasons Why You Should Learn Python in 2019



Python is an object-oriented and open-source language developed in the 1980s
by **Dutchman Guido van Rossum**. Tech Giants like Cisco, IBM, Mozilla,
Google, Quora, Hewlett-Packard, Dropbox, and Qualcomm are using this language
owing to its simplicity and elegance. Most developers prefer Python over the
plethora of programming languages out there because of its emphasis on
**readability** and **efficiency**. There are several reasons why you should
consider Python training. A course in Python can provide numerous benefits to
the users.

Following are the major features and applications of Python that has
influenced more and more people to learn Python and gain certification.

 **1\. Data Science:** Python is the preferred programming language of most
data scientists. Be it IT ops, software development or marketing, currently
every job makes use of data and depends on it to drive their operations. With
the release of **‘Numpy‘** and **‘Pandas’** , Python rose to prominence in the
world of data. Python also handles statistical, tabular and matrix data and
also visualizes it with libraries like **‘Matplotlib’** and **‘Seaborn‘.**  
Moreover, in the data science arena, python job postings outnumber all others.
This indicates the fact that the skills you gain with Python will directly
transfer to developing your analytic skills.

 **2\. Easy to Learn:** Python is an easy language to master. This is chiefly
because of its resemblance to the English language. Python’s syntax is
characterized by very few rules and special cases. It’s safe to say that in
Python the focus is on what you want to do with the code, not on language
intricacies. Anybody can master Python easily. With practice, newbies can
build a basic game in mere days using python. Another attractive aspect of
this programming language is its efficiency and readability.

  

  

 **3\. Cross-Platform and Open Source:** It’s been more than 20 years since
this language has been running cross-platform and open source. Be it **Linux,
Windows** or **MacOS** , Python code works on every platform. Another
remarkable thing about Python is that it’s supported by decades of bug-
squashing and kink-straightening which ensures that its code works as intended
whenever the user runs it.

 **4\. Versatile Language and Platform:** Python remains very relevant today
as it can be used in any operations scenario or software development, be it in
managing local and cloud infrastructure, working against a SQL database,
developing a custom function for Hive & Pig, supporting object-oriented design
or even developing a small tool for the user.

 **5\. Vast Libraries:** Python is supported by **PyPI** which has _85,000+_
python scripts and modules accessible to the user. These modules provide pre-
packaged functionality available to the users in their local Python
environment. It can solve diverse problems such as executing advanced data
analytics like developing REStful web services or sentiment analysis and
establishing computer vision.

 **6\. Flexibility:** Python has several powerful applications integrated with
other programming languages. Details about these are given as follows:

  * .Net and C# compatible: IronPython
  * A version with C: CPython
  * Python combined with Ruby: RubyPython
  * Python integrated with Java: Jython
  * Python written with Objective C toolkits: PyObjc

 **7\. High Salary:** The salary of Python engineers is comparatively higher
as compared to others in the industry. In the United States, a Python
developer earns an average of **$116,028** per year.

 **8\. Scripting and Automation:** What most people don’t know about Python is
that it can be used as a scripting language. In scripting, the code is written
in script form and gets executed. So the code is read and interpreted by the
machine and errors are checked during runtime. After the code is checked, it
can be used many times. It is also possible to automate specific tasks in a
problem by automation.

 **9\. Artificial Intelligence:** Without any dispute, Artificial intelligence
is going to lead the future IT. Python’s libraries such as **Keras** and
**TensorFlow** enables machine learning functionality. Also, libraries like
**OpenCV** aids in computer vision or image recognition.

 **10\. Computer Graphics:** Python can be employed in small, large, online or
offline projects. It is used to develop GUI and desktop applications. It’s
**‘Tkinter’** library enables simple and rapid application development. This
programming language is also used in game development where the logic is
written using a module _‘pygame’_ which can also run on android devices.

 **11\. Testing Framework:** This language is an excellent tool for validating
the products or ideas for established enterprises. Python has numerous built-
in testing frameworks that deal with debugging and rapid workflows. Its tools
and modules such as _Selenium_ and _Splinter_ work to make things easier.
Python also supports cross-platform and cross-browser testing with frameworks
like _PyTest_ and _Robot_ framework.

 **12\. Web Development:** Python’s different frameworks support website
development. Python has an array of frameworks for developing websites.
Popular frameworks such as _Django, Flask,_ and _Pylons_ are characterized by
faster and stable code; this is because they are written in Python. Using
Python, the users can perform web scraping which means fetching details from
other websites.
