Python | Plotting Combined charts in excel sheet using XlsxWriter module



 **Prerequisite:** Create and Write on an excel sheet

 **XlsxWriter** is a Python library using which one can perform multiple
operations on excel files like creating, writing, arithmetic operations and
plotting graphs. Letâ€™s see how to plot Combined charts using realtime data.

Charts are composed of at least one series of one or more data points. Series
themselves are comprised of references to cell ranges. For plotting the charts
on an excel sheet, firstly, create chart object of specific chart type( i.e
Line, Column chart etc.). After creating chart objects, insert data in it and
lastly, add that chart object in the sheet object.

 **Code #1 :** Plot a combined column and line chart that share the same X and
Y axes.  
For plotting the Combined chart on an excel sheet, use combine() method of
the chart object for combining Two chart objects together.

 **Code #2 :** Plot a combined column and line chart in which the secondary
chart will have a secondary Y axis.  
For plotting the Combined chart with secondary Y axis on an excel sheet, We
set a secondary Y axis via 'y2_axis'. keyword argument of the add_series()
method of the respective chart object .
