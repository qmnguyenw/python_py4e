Python | Working with Pandas and XlsxWriter | Set â€“ 1



Python Pandas is a data analysis library. It can read, filter and re-arrange
small and large datasets and output them in a range of formats including
Excel.

 **Pandas** writes Excel files using the XlsxWriter modules.

 **XlsxWriter** is a Python module for writing files in the XLSX file
format. It can be used to write text, numbers, and formulas to multiple
worksheets. Also, it supports features such as formatting, images, charts,
page setup, auto filters, conditional formatting and many others.
