Z score for Outlier Detection â€“ Python



Z score is an important concept in statistics. Z score is also called standard
score. This score helps to understand if a data value is greater or smaller
than mean and how far away it is from the mean. More specifically, Z score
tells how many standard deviations away a data point is from the mean.

>  **Z score = (x -mean) / std. deviation**

A normal distribution is shown below and it is estimated that  
68% of the data points lie between +/- 1 standard deviation.  
95% of the data points lie between +/- 2 standard deviation  
99.7% of the data points lie between +/- 3 standard deviation

 **Z score and Outliers:**  
If the z score of a data point is more than 3, it indicates that the data
point is quite different from the other data points. Such a data point can be
an outlier.  
For example, in a survey, it was asked how many children a person had.  
Suppose the data obtained from people is

> 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 15, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2
>
>  
>
>
>  
>

Clearly, 15 is an outlier in this dataset.

 **Let us use calculate the Z score using Python to find this outlier.**  
 **Step 1: Import necessary libraries**

 __  
 __  
 __

import numpy as np   
  
---  
  
__

**Step 2: Calculate mean, standard deviation**

data= [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 15, 2,
2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2]

mean = np.mean(data)

std = np.std(data)

print('mean of the dataset is', mean)

print('std. deviation is', std)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output:**

    
    
    mean of the dataset is 2.6666666666666665
    std. deviation is 3.3598941782277745

 **Step 3: Calculate Z score. If Z score >3, print it as an outlier.**

threshold= 3

outlier = []

for i in data:

 z = (i-mean)/std

 if z > threshold:

 outlier.append(i)

print('outlier in dataset is', outlier)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output:**

    
    
    outlier in dataset is [15]

 **Conclusion** : Z score helps us identify outliers in the data.
