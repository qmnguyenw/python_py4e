PyQt5 â€“ How to add icon to Radio Button ?



In this article we will see how to set logo to a radio button. By default
there is no logo set to the radio button, although we can set icon to the
radio button it is similar to setting icon to a main window but unlike main
window, icon of radio button appear in between the indicator and the text
part.

Below is how default radio button looks vs the the radio button with icon
looks like.

> **In order to add icon to the radio button we have to do the following:**
>
> 1\. Create a radio button.  
> 2\. Load the icon and create the object with the help of QIcon class  
> 3\. Set the object of QIcon as icon to the radio button with the help of
> setIcon method.

Below is the implementation.
