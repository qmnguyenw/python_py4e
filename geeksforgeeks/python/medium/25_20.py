numpy.zeros() in Python



The **numpy.zeros()** function returns a new array of given shape and type,
with zeros.  
 **Syntax:**

    
    
    numpy.zeros(shape, dtype = None, order = 'C')

 **Parameters :**

    
    
    **shape :** integer or sequence of integers
    **order  :** C_contiguous or F_contiguous
             C-contiguous order in memory(last index varies the fastest)
             C order means that operating row-rise on the array will be slightly quicker
             FORTRAN-contiguous order in memory (first index varies the fastest).
             F order means that column-wise operations will be faster. 
    **dtype :** [optional, float(byDeafult)] Data type of returned array.  
    

**Returns :**

    
    
    ndarray of zeros having given shape, order and datatype.

zero or random values respectively.Also, these codes wonâ€™t run on online-ID.
