OpenCV Python Tutorial



 **OpenCV** is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine
learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming
languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to
identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. When it is
integrated with various libraries, such as Numpy which is a highly optimized
library for numerical operations, then the number of weapons increases in your
Arsenal i.e whatever operations one can do in Numpy can be combined with
OpenCV.

This OpenCV tutorial will help you learn the Image-processing from Basics to
Advance, like operations on Images, Videos using a huge set of Opencv-programs
and projects.
