How to make a basic Scatterplot using Python-Plotly?



 **Plotly** is a graphing library for making high quality interactive graphs
and charts. It is an open source library used for data visualization . This
library can be used with three programming languages namely Python, R and
Javascript. Using Plotly is very easy and you can make any type of graph using
this library. It can generate Statistical charts, financial charts, Scientific
charts, maps , 3D charts, subplots, etc.

But there are many other libraries like seaborn , matplotlib, bokeh available
for data visualization. Then, why to choose Plotly?

## Advantages of Plotly

  * It provides large number of functions to visualize any kind of data .
  * It is very simple, user friendly yet flexible.
  * It allows you to embed your interactive plots in your project using HTML.
  * Compatible with number of programming languages like ruby, python, javascript, matlab, etc.
  * Plotly also have Plotly Chart Studio where you can directly edit your plots without writing single line of code.

## How to make a basic Scatterplot using Plotly and Python ?

Letâ€™s start with making a very basic plot known as Scatterplot. Scatterplot
helps in finding the relationship between two variables . It tells us whether
the two variables are positively related, negatively related or not related at
all.

 **Example:**

## Python3

import plotly.offline as pyo

import plotly.graph_objs as go

import numpy as np

 

 

# creating random data through randomint

# function of numpy.random

np.random.seed(42)

 

random_x= np.random.randint(1,101,100)

random_y= np.random.randint(1,101,100)

 

# create variable data which holds the data

data=[go.Scatter(x=random_x,

 y=random_y,

 mode='markers',

 marker= dict(size= 12,

 color= 'rgb(51,204,153)',

 symbol= 'pentagon',

 line= {'width':2}

 ) )]

 

# create layout of scatter plot

layout=go.Layout(title='Random Scatter Plot',

 xaxis= {'title':'X-AXIS'} ,

 yaxis= dict(title='Y-AXIS'),

 hovermode= 'closest' )

 

# create figure variable to pass the

# data and Layout

fig= go.Figure(data=data , layout=layout)

 

# call plot function using plotly offline

pyo.plot(fig, filename='scatterplot-1.html')
