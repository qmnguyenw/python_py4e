Pedestrian Detection using OpenCV-Python



OpenCV is an open-source library, which is aimed at real-time computer vision.
This library is developed by Intel and is cross-platform â€“ it can support
Python, C++, Java, etc. Computer Vision is a cutting edge field of Computer
Science that aims to enable computers to understand what is being seen in an
image. OpenCV is one of the most widely used libraries for Computer Vision
tasks like face recognition, motion detection, object detection, etc.

In this tutorial, we are going to build a basic **Pedestrian Detector** for
images and videos using OpenCV. Pedestrian detection is a very important area
of research because it can enhance the functionality of a pedestrian
protection system in Self Driving Cars.

We can extract features like head, two arms, two legs, etc, from an image of a
human body and pass them to train a machine learning model. After training,
the model can be used to detect and track humans in images and video streams.
However, OpenCV has a built-in method to detect pedestrians. It has a pre-
trained **HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradients) + Linear SVM model** to detect
pedestrians in images and video streams.

 **Histogram of Oriented Gradients**

This algorithm checks directly surrounding pixels of every single pixel. The
goal is to check how darker is the current pixel compared to the surrounding
pixels. The algorithm draws and arrows showing the direction of the image
getting darker. It repeats the process for each and every pixel in the image.
At last, every pixel would be replaced by an arrow, these arrows are called
**Gradients**. These gradients show the flow of light from light to dark. By
using these gradients algorithms perform further analysis. To learn more about
HOG, read Navneet Dalal and Bill Triggs research paper on HOG for Human
Detection..
