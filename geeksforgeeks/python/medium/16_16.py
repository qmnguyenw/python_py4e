Python | Get the string after occurrence of given substring



Sometimes, more than finding a substring, we might need to get the string
which is occurring after the substring has been found. Letâ€™s discuss certain
ways in which this task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Usingpartition()**  
The partition function can be used to perform this task in which we just
return the part of partition occurring after the partition word.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Get String after substring occurrence

# using partition()

 

# initializing string 

test_string = "GeeksforGeeks is best for geeks"

 

# initializing split word

spl_word = 'best'

 

# printing original string 

print("The original string : " + str(test_string))

 

# printing split string 

print("The split string : " + str(spl_word))

 

# using partition()

# Get String after substring occurrence

res = test_string.partition(spl_word)[2]

 

# print result

print("String after the substring occurrence : " + res)

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original string : GeeksforGeeks is best for geeks
    The split string : best
    String after the substring occurrence :  for geeks
    

**Method #2 : Usingsplit()**  
The split function can also be applied to perform this particular task, in
this function, we use the power of limiting the split and then print the later
string.

    The split string : best
    String after the substring occurrence :  for geeks
