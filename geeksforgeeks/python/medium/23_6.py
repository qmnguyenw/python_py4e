Python | Program to extract frames using OpenCV



 **OpenCV** comes with many powerful video editing functions. In current
scenario, techniques such as image scanning, face recognition can be
accomplished using OpenCV.

OpenCv library can be used to perform multiple operations on videos. Letâ€™s try
to do something interesting using CV2. Take a video as input and break the
video into frame by frame and save those frame. Now, number of operations can
be performed on these frames. Like reversing the video file or crop the video
etc. For playing video in reverse mode, we need only to store the frames in a
list and iterate reverse in the list of frames. Use reverse method of the list
for reversing the order of frames in the list.

 **Function Used :**

>  **VideoCapture(File_path) :** Read the video(.mp4 format)
>
>  **read() :**
