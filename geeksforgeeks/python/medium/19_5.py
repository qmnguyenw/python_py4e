Creating a Pandas Series from Lists



A **Series** is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data
type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). It has
to be remembered that unlike Python lists, a Series will always contain data
of the same type.

Letâ€™s see how to create a Pandas Series from lists.

 **Method #1 :** Using Series() method without any argument.

 __  
 __  
 __

# import pandas as pd

import pandas as pd

 

# create Pandas Series with default index values

# default index ranges is from 0 to len(list) - 1

x = pd.Series(['Geeks', 'for', 'Geeks'])

 

# print the Series

print(x)

**Method #2 :** Using Series() method with 'index' argument.

 __  
 __

# import pandas lib. as pd

import pandas as pd

 

# create Pandas Series with define indexes

x = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40, 50], index
=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'])

 

# print the Series

print(x)

 __

# import pandas lib. as pd

import pandas as pd

 

ind = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]

 

lst = ['Geeks', 'for', 'Geeks', 'is',

 'portal', 'for', 'geeks']

 

# create Pandas Series with define indexes

x = pd.Series(lst, index = ind)

 

# print the Series

print(x)  
  
---

 **Method #3:** Using Series() method with multi-list

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# importing pandas

import pandas as pd

 

# multi-list

list = [ ['Geeks'], ['For'], ['Geeks'], ['is'],

 ['a'], ['portal'], ['for'], ['geeks'] ]

 

# create Pandas Series

df = pd.Series((i[0] for i in list))

 

print(df)
