R vs Python in Datascience



Data science deals with identifying, representing and extracting meaningful
information from data sources to be used to perform some business logics.The
data scientist uses machine learning, statistics, probability, linear and
logistic regression and more in order to make out some meaningful data.
Finding patterns and similar combinations and cracking the best possible path
way according to the business logic is the biggest job of analysis.

R, Python, SQL, SAS, Tableau, MATLAB, etc. are of the most useful tools for
data science, R and Python being the most used ones. But still, it becomes
confusing for any newbie to choose the better or the most suitable one among
the two, R and Python. Let’s try to visualize the difference.

 **Overview :** R| Python| R is a programming language and free software
environment for statistical computing and graphics, supported by the R
Foundation for Statistical Computing. It was designed by Ross Ihaka and Robert
Gentleman and first released in August, 1993. It is widely used among
statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data
analysis.| Python is an Interpreted high-level programming language for
general purpose programming. It was created by Guido Van Rossum and was first
released in 1991. Python has a very clean and simple code syntax. It
emphasizes code readability and thus debugging is also far more simpler and
easier in Python.

 **Specialities for datascience :** R| Python| R packages cover advanced
techniques which very useful for statistical work. The CRAN text view provides
you with many useful R packages. R packages cover everything from
Psychometrics to Genetics to Finance. On the other hand, Python, with the help
of libraries like SciPy and packages like statsmodels, covers only the most
common techniques.| R and Python are equally good for finding outliers in a
data set, but for developing a web service to enable other people to upload
datasets and find outliers, Python is better. People have built modules to
create websites, interact with a variety of databases, and manage users in
Python. In general, to create a tool or service that uses data analysis,
Python is a better choice.

 **Functionalities :**

  

  
R| Python| R has inbuilt functionalities for data analysis. R was built by
eminent statisticians with statistics and data analysis in mind, so many tools
that have been externally added to Python through packages are built in R by
default.| Python is a general purpose programming language. So most of the
data analysis functionalities are not inbuilt and are available through
packages like Numpy and Pandas, which are available in PyPi(Python Package
Index).

 **Key domains of application :** R| Python| Data visualization is a key
aspect of analysis, as visual data is best understood. R packages like
ggplot2, ggvis, lattice, etc. make data visualization easier in R. Python is
catching up with packages like Bokeh, Matplotlib, etc. but is still far behind
in this regard.| Python is better for deep learning. Packages like Lasagne,
Caffe, Keras, Mxnet, OpenNN, Tensor flow, etc. allows development of deep
neural networks far more simple in Python. Although some of these, like tensor
flow, are being ported to R(packages like deepnet, H2O, etc.) but it is still
better in Python.  
---|---  
  
 **Availability of Packages :** R| Python| R has hundreds of packages and ways
to accomplish needful data science tasks. Although it allows to have desired
perfection in completing the task, it makes it difficult for inexperienced
developers to achieve certain goals.| Python relies on a few main packages,
viz., Scikit learn and Pandas are the packages for machine learning data
analysis respectively. It makes easier to accomplish required tasks but
consequently it becomes difficult to achieve specialization.  
---|---  
  
Ultimately it’s the job of data scientist itself to choose the most suitable
language as needed. For statistical background, R might be a better option.
But for the CS background or even a beginner, Python is most suitable option.
But, it’s better to have sound knowledge of both cause both might be useful at
times in data science career.
