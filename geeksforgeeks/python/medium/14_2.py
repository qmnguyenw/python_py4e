5 Best Programming Languages For Newbies



Learning a first programming language is always special for everyone. We get
attached to it and it sticks with us forever. You might have 10 years old, 12
years old, 15 years old or whatever your age was, we are sure it was
definitely special for you and it will be in the future as well. After all,
you put so many efforts and you experienced a lot of pain in making your first
program or debugging a simple syntax error but once you saw your code run
successfully and you got your desired output on the screen, you smiled, you
were excited, you forgot all your pain and you realized that you can become a
good coder and move to the next step.

Learning programming in a different era, at different age is completely
different. Today programming has become fairly simple to learn. So many easy
to pick languages are there for kids. Their syntax is easy to learn and kids
can easily build the fundamentals of coding concepts to apply their knowledge
practically in creating some amazing games or websites. Teaching programming
to the kids helps in building other skills as well. They become good in
mathematics, reading and develop good problem solving and analytical reasoning
skills.  
We are going to discuss some programming languages that kids can pick up and
start with it but keep in mind that picking up one of these languages should
be different for the different age groups. It should be according to their
age, interests and definitely their ability to grasp the concepts.

### 1\. Scratch

Kids between the age of 8 to 16 are generally interested in stories, arts,
music, animations, games and what could be the best thing for them if they can
create these amazing things on their own. Scratch makes it possible which is
best suited for younger children and available online for free. If your kid is
not a solid typist then this language is best for them to start with. The
platform provides easy to use block interface it means kids can simply drag
and drop code blocks to animate characters, create games, and build apps.  
You will also find a big online community supporting scratch with over 15
million registered users all over the world. Scratch platform and its
community also allow you to store your projects and their code on the Scratch
server. Scratch server which allows your kid to study how complex games are
created by advanced users. You can get scratch from https://scratch.mit.edu.

### 2\. Python

Python is one of the most popular and easiest programming languages in the
world which is not just the choice of young coders but also the best option
for experienced programmers. Python syntax is like a regular English language
where you don’t need to add comments to the code. Python code is well enough
to explain everything to its reader so kids won’t face any difficulty in
understanding its syntax. Python is popular and widely used in the scientific
field, Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity and lots of other areas so kids
interested in these area can choose this language.  
A lot of common functionalities are already built into this language. Someone
can achieve a lot of things by simply using Python core libraries in their
code while building any application. These all are the reason Python is best
for kids to learn. If your kid is picking up this language then he/she can
transform the ideas into the code and run it in little time. This language
helps kids a lot in getting a basic grasp on how to think like a programmer.
Python has also a huge community focused on using it in computer education.

  

  

### 3\. Ruby

Ruby is also one of the easiest languages to use and its syntax is like normal
English speech. So just like in python Ruby’s syntax is self-explanatory so it
takes less time to explain the code to kids. It’s readable and clear syntax
makes coding easier for children. Ruby is a natural, robust, consistent and
easy to remember language and these great features help kids to learn the
concepts and use it practically writing good scripts. Ruby has also integrated
with the object-oriented programming concept.  
There is one limitation using this language. This language is good for desktop
application but for a web application, someone has to learn _Ruby on Rails_
which introduces more complex concepts and not good for beginners to start
with.

### 4\. Java

Java is one of the most widely used programming languages to learn but frankly
speaking it’s not a favorite programming language for kids and good for
intermediate coders. Java is a bit harder than Python or Ruby but kids who are
interested in making android applications or game engines and want a deep
understanding of coding can pick up this language.  
There is a popular game Minecraft that runs on java attracted kids to learn
this language. While playing this game student understand the java principle,
they learn how to use logic and solve the problems. Java has statically typed
language so you need to write code for everything using this language and that
requires a lot of patience in kids so choose this language wisely for your
kid.

### 5\. C#

If your kid is interested in making 3D games (like Unity) or applications for
windows then this language is the best to start with. C# is one of the most
in-demand languages for jobs in companies and its syntax is similar to Java so
learning one of these languages becomes easier if you have worked with the
other one. C# has rich class libraries, strong memory backup, automatic
garbage collection and also support from .NET. C# is the best choice for
developers if they want to create windows desktop application.
