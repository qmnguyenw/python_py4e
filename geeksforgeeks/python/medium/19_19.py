Python | Plotting Different types of style charts in excel sheet using
XlsxWriter module



 **Prerequisite:**Create and Write on an excel sheet

 **XlsxWriter** is a Python library using which one can perform multiple
operations on excel files like creating, writing, arithmetic operations and
plotting graphs. Letâ€™s see how to plot different types of Style charts, using
realtime data.

Charts are composed of at least one series of one or more data points. Series
themselves are comprised of references to cell ranges. For plotting the charts
on an excel sheet, firstly, create chart object of specific chart type( i.e
Line, Column chart etc.). After creating chart objects, insert data in it and
lastly, add that chart object in the sheet object.

 **Code :** Plot different types of style charts.

For plotting different types of style charts on an excel sheet, use
set_style()method of the chart object with respective style id .

 # do increment

# The workbook object is then used to add new 

# worksheet via the add_worksheet() method. 

# create a worksheet for writing data. 

data_worksheet = workbook.add_worksheet('Data')

 

# create a data list . 

data = [10, 40, 50, 20, 10, 50]

 

# Write a column of data starting from 'A1'

data_worksheet.write_column('A1', data)

 

# hide the data worksheet

data_worksheet.hide()

 

# Finally, close the Excel file 

# via the close() method. 

workbook.close()
