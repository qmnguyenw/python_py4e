C Vs Python



 **C:** C is a structured, mid-level, general-purpose programming language
that was developed at Bell Laboratories between 1972-73 by Dennis Ritchie. It
was built as a foundation for developing the UNIX operating system. Being a
mid-level language, C lacks the built-in functions that are characteristic of
high-level languages, but it provides all the building blocks that developers
need. C follows the structure-oriented approach, that is, the top-down
approach that fragments a program into smaller functions.

What makes C unique is that it is optimized for low-level memory management
tasks that were previously written in Assembly language (the code follows the
hexadecimal format that can directly access memory locations).This is
precisely why C is used in building OS architectures. Even today, both UNIX
and Linux derivatives are heavily dependent on C for many functions.

 **Python:** Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that
was developed by Guido Rossum in 1989. What makes Python amazing is its simple
syntax that is almost similar to the English language and dynamic typing
capability. The straightforward syntax allows for easy code readability.

Also, being an interpreted language, Python is an ideal language for scripting
and rapid application development on most platforms and is so popular with the
developers. Scripting languages incorporate both interactive and dynamic
functionalities via web-based applications.

Metrices| C| Python| Introduction| C is a general-purpose, procedural computer
programming language.| Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose
programming language.| Speed| Compiled programs execute faster as compared to
interpreted programs.| Interpreted programs execute slower as compared to
compiled programs.| Usage| Program syntax is harder than Python.| It is easier
to write a code in Python as the number of lines is less comparatively.|
Declaration of variables| In C, the type of a variable must be declared when
it is created, and only values of that type must be assigned to it.| There is
no need to declare the type of variable. Variables are untyped in Python. A
given variable can be stuck on values of different types at different times
during the program execution| Error Debugging| In C, error debugging is
difficult as it is a compiler dependent language. This means that it takes the
entire source code, compiles it and then shows all the errors.| Error
debugging is simple. This means it takes only one in instruction at a time and
compiles and executes simultaneously. Errors are shown instantly and the
execution is stopped, at that instruction.| Function renaming mechanism| C
does not support function renaming mechanism. This means the same function
cannot be used by two different names.| Supports function renaming mechanism
i.e, the same function can be used by two different names.| Complexity| The
syntax of a C program is harder than Python.| Syntax of Python programs is
easy to learn, write and read.| Memory-management| In C, the Programmer has to
do memory management on their own.| Python uses an automatic garbage collector
for memory management.| Applications| C is generally used for hardware related
applications.| Python is a General-Purpose programming language.| Built-in
functions| C has a limited number of built-in functions.| Python has a large
library of built-in functions.| Implementing Data Structures| Implementing
data structures requires its functions to be explicitly implemented| Gives
ease of implementing data structures with built-in insert, append functions.|
Pointers| Pointers are available in C.| No pointers functionality available in
Python.

 **Conclusion**

A tough question arises as to when to use Python and when to use C. C vs
Python languages are similar yet have many key differences. These languages
are useful languages to develop various applications. The difference between C
and Python is that Python is a multi-paradigm language and C is a structured
programming language. Python is a general-purpose language that is used for
machine learning, natural language processing, web development and many more.
C is mainly used for hardware-related application development such as
operating systems, network drivers. In the present competitive market, it is
not enough to master only one programming language. To be a versatile and
competent programmer, you need to master multiple languages.
