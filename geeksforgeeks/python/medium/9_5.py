Plotting cross-spectral density in Python using Matplotlib



 **Matlplotlib** is a comprehensive library consisting of modules that are
used for Data Visualization just like MATLAB. Pyplot is a further module which
makes functions and methods executable.

## Plotting Cross-Spectral Density

The cross-spectral density compares two signals, each from different source
taking into account both amplitude and phase difference of the two signals. In
Python, this function is carried out using the Pyplot moduleâ€™s method
matplotlib.pyplot.csd()

 **Syntax:**

    
    
    matplotlib.pyplot.csd(x, y)

Here, x and y are 1-D arrays or a sequence having the data.

 **Let us take two signals and plot their CSD:**

  

  

  1. Signal 1 has time period from 0 to 1 second and 0.1 radian phase angle with frequency being calculated using sin() function.
  2. Similarly, Signal 2 has time period from 5 to 10 seconds and 0.25 radians phase angle.
  3. Taking these two signals, we plot their cross spectral density.
