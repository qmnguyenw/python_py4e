Python Tkinter â€“ ScrolledText Widget



 **Tkinter** is a built-in standard python library. With the help of Tkinter,
many GUI applications can be created easily. There are various types of
widgets available in Tkinter such as button, frame, label, menu, scrolledtext,
canvas and many more. A widget is an element that provides various controls.
ScrolledText widget is a text widget with a scroll bar. The
tkinter.scrolledtext module provides the text widget along with a scroll
bar. This widget helps the user enter multiple lines of text with convenience.
Instead of adding a Scroll bar to a text widget, we can make use of a
scrolledtext widget that helps to enter any number of lines of text.

In the first example, as you can see the cursor, the user can enter any number
of lines of text. In the second example, the user can just read the text which
is displayed in the text box and cannot edit/enter any lines of text. We may
observe that the scroll bar disappears automatically if the text entered by
the user is less than the size of the widget.
