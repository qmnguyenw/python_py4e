Major Kernel Functions in Support Vector Machine (SVM)



 **Kernel Function** is a method used to take data as input and transform into
the required form of processing data. “Kernel” is used due to set of
mathematical functions used in Support Vector Machine provides the window to
manipulate the data. So, Kernel Function generally transforms the training set
of data so that
