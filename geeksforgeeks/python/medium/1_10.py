How to Create an Ogive Graph in Python?



In this article, we will create an **Ogive Graph.** An ogive graph can also be
called as cumulative histograms, this graph is used to determine the number of
values that lie above or below a particular value in a data set. The class
interval is plotted on the x-axis whereas the cumulative frequency is plotted
on the y-axis. These points are plotted on the graph and joined by lines.

NumPy has a function named a **histogram()** that represents the frequency of
data in a particular set range graphically. The histogram function returns two
values first one is the frequency and which is stored in values and the second
one is the bin values or the interval between which the numbers from the
dataset lie, it is stored in the base variable.

After this we will calculate the cumulative sum which can be done easily with
the **cumsum()** function, it returns the cumulative sum along a particular
axis. At last, we will plot the graph using **plot()** function and passing
base as x-axis value and cumsum as y-axis value. We can format the graph using
markers, color, and linestlye attributes.

 **Example 1: (More than Ogive graph)**

The more than ogive graph shows the number of values greater than the class
intervals. The resultant graph shows the number of values in between the class
interval. Eg- 0-10,10-20 and so on. Let us take a dataset, and we will now
plot itâ€™s more than ogive graph- [22,87,5,43,56,73,
55,54,11,20,51,5,79,31,27].

  

  

 **Table representing intervals, frequency and cumulative frequency(less
than)-** **Class Interval**|  **Frequency**|  **Cumulative Frequency**|  0-10|
2|  2|  10-20|  1|  3|  20-30|  3|  6|  30-40|  1|  7|  40-50|  1|  8|  50-60|
4|  12|  60-70|  0|  12|  70-80|  2|  14|  80-90|  1|  15  
---|---|---  
  
 **Approach:**

  * Import the modules (matplotlib and numpy).
  * Calculate the frequency and cumulative frequency of the data.
  * Plot it using the plot() function.

# creating dataset

data = [22, 87, 5, 43, 56, 73, 55, 54,
11, 20, 51, 5, 79, 31, 27]

 

# creating class interval

classInterval = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,
70, 80, 90]

 

# calculating frequency and class interval

values, base = np.histogram(data, bins=classInterval)

 

# calculating cumulative sum

cumsum = np.cumsum(values)

 

# plotting the ogive graph

plt.plot(base[1:], cumsum, color='red', marker='o',
linestyle='-')

 

# formatting

plt.title('Ogive Graph')

plt.xlabel('Marks in End-Term')

plt.ylabel('Cumulative Frequency')

 **Example 2: (Less than Ogive Graph)**

In this example, we will plot less than Ogive graph which will show the less
than values of class intervals. Dataset:[44,27,5,2,43,56,77,53,89,54,11,23,
51,5,79,25,39]

 **Table representing intervals, frequency and cumulative frequency(more
than)-** **Class Interval**|  **Frequency**|  **Cumulative Frequency**|  0-10|
3 |  17|  10-20|  1|  16|  20-30|  3|  14|  30-40|  1|  14|  40-50|  2|  10|
50-60|  4|  8|  60-70|  0|  7|  70-80|  2|  4|  80-90|  1|  3  
---|---|---  
  
Approach is same as above only the cumulative sum that we will calculate will
be reversed using **flipud()** function present in the numpy library.
