Python Design Patterns



 **Design Patterns** is the most essential part of Software Engineering, as
they provide the general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem
in software design. They usually represent some of the best practices adopted
by experienced object-oriented software developers.

We can not consider the **Design Patterns** as the finished design that can be
directly converted into code. They are only templates that describe how to
solve a particular problem with great efficiency. To know more about design
patterns basics, refer – Introduction to Design Patterns.

### Classification of Design Patterns

## Creational Design Pattern:

Creational patterns provides essential information regarding the Class
instantiation or the object instantiation. Class Creational Pattern and the
Object Creational pattern is the major categorization of the Creational Design
Patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the
instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to
get the job done.

 **Classification of Creational Design Patterns –**

  *  **Factory Method**
  *  **Abstract Factory Method**
  *  **Builder Method**
  *  **Prototype Method**
  *  **Singleton Method**

## Structural Design Patterns:

Structural design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects
to form larger structures and provide new functionality while keeping these
structures flexible and efficient. Mostly they use Inheritance to compose all
the interfaces. It also identifies the relationships which led to the
simplification of the structure.

  

  

 **Classification of Structural Design Patterns –**

  *  **Adapter Method**
  *  **Bridge Method**
  *  **Composite Method**
  *  **Decorator Method**
  *  **Facade Method**
  *  **Proxy Method**
  *  **FlyWeight Method**

## Behavioral Design Pattern:

Behavioral patterns are all about identifying the common communication
patterns between objects and realize these patterns. These patterns are
concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between
objects.

 **Classification of Behavioral Design Patterns –**

  *  **Chain of Responsibility Method**
  *  **Command Method**
  *  **Iterator Method**
  *  **Mediator Method**
  *  **Memento Method**
  *  **Observer Method**
  *  **State Method**
  *  **Strategy Method**
  *  **Template Method**
  *  **Visitor Method**

### Advantages of using Design Patterns

  *  **Reusability:** By using **Inheritance** , they helps in making the code reusable and hence we can use them in multiple projects.
  *  **Transparent:** It improves the transparency of the code for all the developers who are going to use it in future.
  *  **Established Solution:** We can blindly believe on the solution provided by **Design Patterns** as they are well-proved and testified at critical stages.
  *  **Established Communication:** Design patterns make communication between designers more efficient. Software professionals can immediately picture the high-level design in their heads when they refer the name of the pattern used to solve a particular issue when discussing system design.
  *  **Efficient Development:** Design patterns helps in the development of the highly cohesive modules with minimal coupling.
