Debugging Python code using breakpoint() and pdb



While developing an application or exploring some features of a language, one
might need to debug the code anytime. Therefore, having an idea of debugging
the code is quite necessary. Letâ€™s see some basics of debugging using built-in
function **breakpoint()** and **pdb module**.

We know that debugger plays an important role when we want to find a bug in a
particular line of code. Here, Python comes with the latest built-in function
_breakpoint_ which do the same thing as pdb.set_trace() in **Python 3.6**
and below versions.

Debugger finds the bug in the code line by line where we add the breakpoint,
if a bug is found then program stops temporarily then you can remove the error
and start to execute the code again.

 **Syntax:**

    
    
    1) breakpoint()           # in Python 3.7 
            
    2) import pdb; pdb.set_trace()   # in Python 3.6 and below
    

  
**Method #1 :** Using **breakpoint()** function  
In this method, we simply introduce the breakpoint where you have doubt or
somewhere you want to check for bugs or errors.

def debugger(a, b):

 breakpoint()

 result = a / b

 return result

 

print(debugger(5, 0))

In order to run the debugger just type **c** and press enter.

**Commands for debugging :**

    
    
     **c** -> continue execution
    **q** -> quit the debugger/execution
    **n** -> step to next line within the same function
    **s** -> step to next line in this function or a called function
    

**Method #2 :** Using **pdb module**  
As the same suggests, PDB means Python debugger. To use the PDB in the program
we have to use one of its method named set_trace(). Although this will
result the same but this the another way to introduce the debugger in python
version 3.6 and below.

 import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

 result = a / b
