GridLayouts in Kivy | Python



Kivy is a platform independent as it can be run on Android, IOS, linux and
Windows etc. Kivy provides you the functionality to write the code for once
and run it on different platforms. It is basically used to develop the Android
application, but it does not mean that it can not be used on Desktop
applications.

Use this command To install kivy:

    
    
    pip install kivy

 **Gridlayout** is the function which creates the children and arrange them
in a matrix format. It takes the available space(square) and divides that
space into rows and columns then add the widgets accordingly to the resulting
cells or grids.  
We can not explicitly place the widgets in a particular column/row. Each child
is assigned a particular position automatically determined by the layout
configuration and the child index in children list. A gridlayout must
contain at least on input constraints i.e. cols and rows. If we do not specify
the cols or rows to it, the layout gives you an exception.

#### Coloumn and Row ‚Äì

Now the Coulums represent the width and the rows represents the hight just
like matrix.

  

  

  * Initial the size is given by the col_default_width and row_default_height properties. We can force the default size by setting the col_force_default or row_force_default property. This will force the layout to ignore the width and _size_hint_ properties of children and use the default size.
  * To customize the size of a single column or row, use cols_minimum or rows_minimum.
  * It is not necessary to give both rows and columns, it depends on the requirement. We can provide either both or anyone accordingly.

In the given below example, all the widgets will have the same or equal size.
By default, the size is (1, 1) so the child will take full size of the parent.

 **Code #1:**

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# my.kv file code here

<MainWidget>:

 

 cols: 2

 rows: 2

 

 Button: 

 text: 'Hello 1'

 Button:

 text: 'World 1'

 Button:

 text: 'Hello 2'

 Button: 

 text: 'World 2'

 **Note:** To run this code you have to make the main.py python file for the
above python code and another file my.kv file.  

**Code #2:**

Now let‚Äôs fix the size of the buttons to 100px instead of default _size_hint_x
= 1_.

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# just do change in the above my.kv

# (code #1) file else all are same.

<MainWidget>:

 

 cols: 2

 rows: 2

 

 Button: 

 text: 'Hello 1'

 size_hint_x: None

 width: 100

 Button:

 text: 'World 1'

 Button:

 text: 'Hello 2'

 size_hint_x: None

 width: 100

 Button: 

 text: 'World 2'

 **Code #3:**

We can also fix the row hight to a specific size.

 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# just do change in the above my.kv

# (code #1)file else all are same.

 

<MainWidget>:

 

 cols: 2

 rows: 2

 row_force_default: True

 row_default_height: 40

 Button: 

 text: 'Hello 1'

 size_hint_x: None

 width: 100

 Button:

 text: 'World 1'

 Button:

 text: 'Hello 2'

 size_hint_x: None

 width: 100

 Button: 

 text: 'World 2'
