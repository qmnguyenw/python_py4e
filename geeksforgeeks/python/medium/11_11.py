How to Install Python Pandas on Windows and Linux?



Pandas in Python is a package that is written for data analysis and
manipulation. Pandas offer various operations and data structures to perform
numerical data manipulations and time series. Pandas is an open-source library
that is built over Numpy libraries. Pandas library is known for its high
productivity and high performance. Pandas is popular because it makes
importing and analyzing data much easier.

Pandas programs can be written on any plain text editor like **notepad,
notepad++,** or anything of that sort and saved with a **.py** extension. To
begin with, writing Pandas Codes and performing various intriguing and useful
operations, one must have Python installed on their System. This can be done
by following the step by step instructions provided below:

#### What if Python already exists? Let’s check

To check if your device is pre-installed with Python or not, just go to the
**Command line** (search for **cmd** in the Run dialog( __**\+ R** ).  
Now run the following command:

    
    
    python --version
    

If Python is already installed, it will generate a message with the Python
version available.

#### Downloading and Installing Pandas

Pandas can be installed in multiple ways on Windows and on Linux. Various
different ways are listed below:

#### Windows

Python Pandas can be installed on Windows in two ways:

  * Using pip
  * Using Anaconda

#### Install Pandas using pip

PIP is a package management system used to install and manage software
packages/libraries written in Python. These files are stored in a large “on-
line repository” termed as Python Package Index (PyPI).  
Pandas can be installed using PIP by the use of the following command:

    
    
    pip install pandas

#### Install Pandas using Anaconda

Anaconda is open-source software that contains Jupyter, spyder, etc that are
used for large data processing, data analytics, heavy scientific computing. If
your system is not pre-equipped with Anaconda Navigator, you can learn **how
to install Anaconda Navigator onWindows or Linux?**  
  
**Steps to Install Pandas using Anaconda Navigator:**  
  
**Step 1:** Search for **Anaconda Navigator** in Start Menu and open it.
