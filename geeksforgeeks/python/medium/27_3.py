 **Adding the script to Startup**

After writing the above code now it is the time to add this Python script to
startup. This can be done in **Ubuntu** as follows:

  1. Firstly, we have to create an executable file for our reminder.py script
  2. This can be done by typing the following command in the terminal
    
         **sudo chmod +x reminder.py** , where reminder.py is our script file name 

  3. Now we have to transfer this file to the path where Linux searches for its default files:  
Type this command in terminal:

    
         **sudo cp /path/to/our/reminder.py /usr/bin**

. This will add our executable script to /usr/bin.

  4. In global search, search for **Startup Applications**
  5. Click on Add and Give a desired Name for your process
  6. Type in the command. For example, our file name is **reminder.py** then type reminder.py in the command field and Select Add

 **NOTE** : The script runs automatically(once added to startup) everytime you
start your system. Also, If you have more than two birthdays on the same day,
both the birthdays will be notified in the notification.
