Whatsapp using Python!



Have you ever wished to automatically wish your friends on their birthdays, or
send a set of messages to your friend ( or any Whastapp contact! )
automatically at a pre-set time, or send your friends by sending thousands of
random text on whatsapp! Using **Browser Automation** you can do all of it and
much more!  
First you must install these:-

1) **Python Bindings for Selenium ( Browser Automation software )**

    
    
    pip install selenium

2) **Chrome webdriver**  
Download Chrome driver from here: Chromedriver download page( choose your
specific version )  
Extract it in a known location , as **we need the location later**

If you get stuck somewhere, Refer To the documentation: Documentation link

3) **Chromium Web Browser( Open source version of chrome browser )**

  

  

    
    
    sudo apt-get install chromium-browser

Thatâ€™s it! You are all set.

Lets dive in right away-

 **Feel free to modify the code. Try to :**

  1. Text Multiple Groups at once
  2. Send the messages from a predefined list of messages randomly or
  3. Send complete random text.
