How to calculate and plot the derivative of a function using Python â€“
Matplotlib ?



In this article, we will plot the derivative of a function using matplotlib
and python. For this we are using some modules in python which are as follows:

  *  **Matplotlib:** **** Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python packages used for data visualization. It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays.
  *  **NumPy:** **** It is a python library that is used for working with arrays, it also supports large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, it also has several mathematical functions.
  *  **SciPy:** **** Python has a library named as SciPy that is used for mathematical, scientific, and engineering calculations. This library depends on NumPy, and provides various numerical operations.

To plot the derivative of a function first, we have to calculate it. The
scipy.misc library has a **derivative()** function which accepts one argument
as a function and the other is the variable w.r.t which we will differentiate
the function. So we will make a method named function() that will return the
original function and a second method named deriv() that will return the
derivative of that function.

After this calculation of the derivative of the input function, we will use
the NumPy **linspace()** function which sets the range of the x-axis. The
plot() function will be used to plot the function and also the derivative of
that function.

 **Approach:**

  * Import the modules required.
  * Define methods for function and its derivative
  * Use NumPy linspace function to make x-axis spacing.
  * Plot the function and its derivative
  * Change the limits of axis using gca() function
  * Plot the text using text() function

 **Example 1: (Derivative of cubic)**

  

  

In this example, we will give the function f(x)=2x3+x+3 as input, then
calculate the derivative and plot both the function and its derivative.

 **Example 2: (Derivative of Poly degree polynomial)**

In this example, we will give the function f(x)=x4+x2+5 as input, then
calculate the derivative and plot both the function and its derivative.

 **Example 3: (Derivative of quadratic with formatting by text)**

In this example, we will plot the derivative of f(x)=4x2+x+1. Also, we will
use some formatting using the **gca()** function that will change the limits
of the axis so that both x, y axes intersect at the origin. The **text()**
function which comes under matplotlib library plots the text on the graph and
takes an argument as (x, y) coordinates. We will also do some formatting.
