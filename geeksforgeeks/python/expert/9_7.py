Python3 for GUI application | An Overview



This article, discusses about the various toolkits to make a **GUI
Application** in Python3. It is easy to start programming a GUI application
after gaining basic python and OOP knowledge. The top five GUI toolkits and a
brief overview on each of them is discussed below.

#### 1\. TKinter :

 ** _TKinter_** is an open source and standard GUI toolkit for Python. TKinter
is a wrapper around tcl / TK graphical interface. TKinter is popular because
of its simplicity and having very old and active community. Also, it comes
included with most binary distributions of Python. TKinter is fully potable
for Macintosh, Windows and Linux platforms. It’s a good toolkit to start with,
since TKinter is mostly preferred for small scale GUI applications.

#### 2\. PyQt :

 ** _PyQt_** toolkit is a wrapper around QT framework. PyQt is one of most
loved cross platform Python binding over C++ implementing QT-library for QT
framework. PyQT can be used for large scaled GUI application, since it takes
no time to develop GUI. One can simply design the window using QT designer and
easily convert the .UI code to .PY (Python) code and after that logics can be
bind to each widget. But at the beginning stage of learning PyQt, writing code
manually is always a good practice, because that how you actually learn.

#### 3\. PySide :

Just like PyQt, **_PySide_** is also a Python binding of the cross-platform
GUI toolkit Qt. PySide was released by Nokia (the former owners of the Qt
toolkit) with LGPL-licence, after Nokia failed to reach an agreement with PyQt
developers Riverbank Computing to change its licensing terms to include LGPL
as an alternative license. It’s totally upto developer’s choice, whether
he/she wants to use PyQt or Pyside.

#### 4\. PyGTK :

 ** _PyGTK_** is an open source software, comes under LGPL licence service.
PyGTK is a cross platform widget toolkit. PyGTK is the standard toolkit for
GNOME. You can find good number of Linux platform GUI, which are developed
with PyGTK.

#### 5\. Kivy :

 ** _Kivy_** is a OpenGL accelerated framework, very popular among developers
for developing GUI apps. Kivy is an opensource Python library, which can also
be used for developing NUI (Natural User Interface). With Kivy, mobile
applications and other multitouch application softwares can be developed.
Applications developed with Kivy can run on Android, IOS, Linux and Windows.
Developing application using Kivy is really interesting. If you ever heard
about this awesome android app ‘2048’, it is developed using Kivy.
