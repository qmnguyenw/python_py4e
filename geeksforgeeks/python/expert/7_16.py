How to Become a Data Scientist in 2019: A Complete Guide



 **There were 5 exabytes of information created between the dawn of
civilization through 2003, but that much information is now created every 2
days.**

This is the age of data. And in this age, the Data Scientists are gods!!! They
are the ones which extremely diverse skill sets ranging from Data Management
to Machine Learning. These multi-talented magicians are chiefly responsible
for converting the data into actionable insights by using self-created
predictive models and custom analysis according to company requirements.

In other words, being a Data Scientist is an extremely important job in the
current data age. So much so that a Harvard Business Review article even
called it the **“Sexiest Job of the 21st Century”** (And that’s incentive
right there to become one!!). And it also doesn’t hurt that being a Data
Scientist pays really well with an average salary of **1,022K** per year. And
that is the reason this article is a complete guide to becoming a Data
Scientist in 2019. This is a roadmap that you can follow if you are interested
in learning more about Data Science.

But there is still a lot of confusion between the differences in the role of a
Data Analyst and Data Scientist so we’ll start our article with that and move
on to other topics like the Education Requirements and Skill Requirements to
Become a Data Scientist.

  

  

### Difference Between a Data Analyst and a Data Scientist

It’s obvious that both a Data Analyst and Data Scientist have a job
description related to data. But what?!! That’s a question that many people
have regarding the differences between a Data Analyst and Data Scientist. So
let’s clear this doubt here!

A **Data Analyst** uses the data to solve various problems and obtain
actionable insights for the company. This is done by using various tools on
well-defined data sets to answer corporate questions like “Why is a marketing
campaign more effective in certain regions” or “Why have product sales reduced
in the current quarter” and so on. For this, the basic skills that a Data
Analyst possesses are **Data Mining, R, SQL, Statistical Analysis, Data
Analysis** , etc. In fact, many Data Analysts gain the extra skills required
and become Data Scientists.

A **Data Scientist** , on the other hand, can design new processes and
algorithms for data modeling, create predictive models and perform custom
analysis on the data according to company requirements. So the main difference
is that a Data Scientist can utilize heavy coding to designing data modeling
processes rather than using the pre-existing ones to obtain answers from the
data like a Data Analyst. For this, the basic skills that a Data Scientist
possesses are _Data Mining, R, SQL, Machine Learning, Hadoop, Statistical
Analysis, Data Analysis, OOPS_ , etc. So the reason that Data Scientists are
more heavily paid than Data Analysts is their high skill levels coupled with
high demand and low supply!

### Education Requirements to Become a Data Scientist

There are many paths to reach your goal as a Data Scientist and you can follow
any of them! But keep in mind that most of these paths pass through a college
as a four-year bachelor’s degree is the minimum requirement (Masters and Ph.D.
certainly don’t hurt!!!)

The most direct path is that you complete a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science
as that will obviously teach you the skills required to collect, analyze and
interpret large amounts of data. You will learn all about _statistics,
analysis techniques, programming languages_ , etc. that will only help in your
job as a Data Scientist.

Another roundabout path you can take is to complete any technical degree that
will help in your role as a Data Scientist. Some of these are Computer
Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Economics, etc. After completing your
degrees you will have skills such as _coding, data handling, quantitative
problem solving_ , etc. that can be applied to Data Science. Then you can
either find an entry-level job or complete a Masters and Ph.D. for more
specialized knowledge.

### Skill Requirements to Become a Data Scientist

Every Data Scientist Ninja must have their tools! And so there are multiple
skills that are required for a Data Scientist ranging across different fields.
Most of them are mentioned below:

 **1\. Statistical Analysis:** As a Data Scientist, your primary job is to
collect, analyze and interpret large amounts of data and produce actionable
insights for a company. So obviously Statistical Analysis is a big part of the
job description!!!  
That means you should be familiar with at least the basics of Statistical
Analysis including **statistical tests, distributions, linear regression,
probability theory, maximum likelihood estimators, etc.** And that’s not
enough! While it is important to understand which statistical techniques are a
valid approach for a given data problem, it is even more important to
understand which ones aren’t. Also, there are many analytical tools that are
immensely helpful in Statistical Analysis as a Data Scientist. The most
popular of these are SAS, Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Pig, etc. So it’s important
that you have a thorough knowledge of them.

 **2\. Programming Skills:** Programming Skills are a necessary tool in your
arsenal as a Data Scientist! That’s because it is much easier to study and
understand data in order to draw useful conclusions if you can use certain
algorithms according to your needs.  
In general, Python and R are the most commonly used languages for this
purpose. Python is used because of its capacity for statistical analysis and
its easy readability. Python also has various packages for machine learning,
data visualization, data analysis, etc. (like Scikitlearn) that make it suited
for data science. R also makes it very easy to solve almost any problem in
Data Science with the help of packages like e1071, rpart, etc.

 **3\. Machine Learning:** If you are in any way connected to the tech
industry, chances are you have heard of Machine Learning! It basically enables
machines to learn a task from experience without programming them
specifically. This is done by training the machines using various machine
learning models using the data and different algorithms.  
So you need to be familiar with Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
algorithms in Machine Learning like **Linear Regression, Logistic Regression,
K-means Clustering, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor,** etc. Luckily, most of
the Machine Learning algorithms can be implemented using R or Python libraries
(mentioned above!) so you don’t need to be an expert on them. What you need
expertise on is the ability to understand which algorithm is required based on
the type of data you have and the task you are trying to automate.

 **4\. Data Management and Data Wrangling:** Data plays a big part in the life
of a Data Scientist (Obviously!). So you need to be proficient in Data
Management which involves Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading. This
means that you have to extract the data from various sources, then transform
it in the required format for analysis and finally load it into a data
warehouse. To handle this data, there are various frameworks available like
Hadoop, Spark, etc.  
Now that you are done with the process of Data Management, you also need to be
familiar with Data Wrangling. Now, what is Data Wrangling you ask? Well, it
basically means that the data in the warehouse needs to be cleaned and unified
in a coherent manner before it can be analyzed to obtain any actionable
insights.

 **5\. Data Intuition:** Don’t underestimate the power of Data Intuition! In
fact, it is the primary non-technical skill that sets a Data Scientist apart
from a Data Analyst. Data Intuition basically involves finding patterns in the
data where there are none! This is almost like finding the needle in the
haystack which is the actual potential in the huge unexplored pile of data.  
Data Intuition is not a skill that you can be easily taught. Rather it comes
from **experience and continued practice**. And this, in turn, makes you much
more efficient and valuable in your role as a Data Scientist.

 **6\. Communication Skills:** You must be great at Communication Skills as
well in order to become an expert Data Scientist! That’s because while you
understand the data better than anyone else, you need to translate your data
findings into quantified insights for a non-technical team to aide in the
decision making.  
This can also involve **data storytelling**! So you should be able to present
your data in a storytelling format with concrete results and values so that
other people can understand what you are saying. That’s because eventually,
the data analysis is less important than the actionable insights that can be
obtained from the data which will, in turn, lead to business growth.
