Pulling a random word or string from a line in a text file in Python



File handling in Python is really simple and easy to implement. In order to
pull a random word or string from a text file, we will first open the file in
**read** mode and then use the methods in Pythonâ€™s **random** module to pick a
random word.

There are various ways to perform this operation:

This is the text file we will read from:

 **Method 1: Using** **random.choice()**

  

  

 **Steps:**

  1. Using **with** function, open the file in read mode. The **with** function takes care of closing the file automatically.
  2. Read all the text from the file and store in a string
  3. Split the string into words separated by space.
  4. Use **random.choice()** to pick a word or string.

# Python code to pick a random

# word from a text file

import random

 

# Open the file in read mode

with open("MyFile.txt", "r") as file:

 allText = file.read()

 words = list(map(str, allText.split()))

 

 # print random string

 print(random.choice(words))

Note: The **split()** function, by default, splits by white space. If you want
any other delimiter like newline character you can specify that as an
argument.

Output for two sample runs

The above can be achieved with just a single line of code like this :

## Python

 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# import required module

import random

 

# print random word

print(random.choice(open("myFile.txt","r").readline().split()))  
  
---

 **Method 2: Using** **random.randint()** ****

**Steps:**

  1. Open the file in read mode using **with** function
  2. Store all data from the file in a string and split the string into words.
  3. Count the total number of words.
  4. Use **random.randint()** to generate a random number between 0 and the _word_count._
  5. Print the word at that position.

## Python

# using randint()

import random

 

# open file

with open("myFile.txt", "r") as file:

 data = file.read()

 words = data.split()

 

 # Generating a random number for word position

 word_pos = random.randint(0, len(words)-1)

 print("Position:", word_pos)

 print("Word at position:", words[word_pos])
