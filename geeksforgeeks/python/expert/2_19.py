Pandas Groupby and Computing Median



The Pandas in Python is known as the most popular and powerful tool for
performing data analysis. It because of the beauty of Pandas functionality and
the ability to work on sets and subsets of the large dataset. So in this
article, we are going to study how pandas Group By functionality works and
saves tons of effort while working on a large dataset. Also, we will solve
real-world problems using Pandas Group By and Median functionalities.

###  **Pandas groupby()**

The groupby() method in pandas splits the dataset into subsets to make
computations easier. Generally, groupby() splits the data, applies the
functionalities, and then combine the result for us. Letâ€™s take an example if
we have data on alcohol consumption of different countries and we want to
perform data analysis continent-wise, this problem can be minimized using
groupby() method in pandas. It splits the data continent-wise and calculates
median using the median() method.

 **Syntax :**

> DataFrame.groupby(by=None, axis=0, level=None, as_index=True, sort=True,
> group_keys=True, squeeze=<object object>, observed=False, dropna=True)

 **Example 1** : Find the median of alcohol consumption continent-wise on a
given dataset.

  

  

 **Dataset:** Drinksbycountry.csv

data.head()

 

# peform groupby on continent and find median

# of total_litres_of_pure_alcohol

data.groupby(["continent"])["total_litres_of_pure_alcohol"].median()

 

# peform groupby on continent and find median 

# of wine_serving

data.groupby(["continent"])["wine_servings"].median()

 **Example 2:** Find the median of the total population group by age on a
given dataset.

 **Dataset:** WorldPopulationByAge2020.csv

# perform group by AgeGrp and find median

data.groupby(["AgeGrp"])["PopTotal"].median()
