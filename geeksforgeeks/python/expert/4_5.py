Draw a car using Turtle in Python



 **Prerequisite:**Turtle module, Drawing Shapes

There are many modules in python which depicts graphical illustrations, one of
them is _turtle_ , it is an in-built module in Python, which lets the user
control a pen( _turtle_ ) to draw on screen(drawing board). It is mostly used
to illustrate figures, shapes, designs etc. In this article, we will learn how
to draw a Car using the _turtle_ module.

**To draw a car in Python using** _ **Turtle**_ **module:**

  1. We are going to create different shapes using the _turtle_ module in-order to illustrate a car.
  2. Tyres can be drawn using _circle()_ function.
  3. The upper body can be thought of a rectangle.
  4. Roof and windows are similar to trapezoid.
  5. Overlapping all the above shapes in particular positions will illustrate a car. 

**Letâ€™s try to understand it better with the help of the below program:**
