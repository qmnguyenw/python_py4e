Setup Python in a Local Computer



Let us see how to **Setup Python in our Local Computer.** We can directly
download the latest version of Python from the official website.

After that, we need to install it on our local computer. After a successful
installation, IDLE(Integrated Development and Learning Environment) will also
be installed on our local computer alongside with some of the packages. For
simple programs, we can use IDLE.

Python programs can also be written in a notepad and run from the command
prompt. For this, follow the steps:

  1. Open the notepad.
  2. Write the code in it.
  3. Save the file with the .py extension.
  4. Open the terminal/command prompt.
  5. For type in the following command >> py filename.py.
  6. The output will be displayed.

 **Example:** We have created a file named hello.py with the content
_print(“Hello world”)._

For large and complex programs, it is more convenient to use a smart IDE.

We can also use online IDEs. Online IDEs are helpful to code from remote
locations on a different computer, they are also used if our computer does not
have space to download software. We can also share our code online with
others.
