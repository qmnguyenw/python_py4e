Top 10 Python IDE and Code Editors in 2020



 **Python…** the most popular and favorite programming language in the world
for programmers of all age groups. If you are a beginner this language is
strongly recommended to learn first. Well, In programming, we all know the
importance of code editor and IDEs to write our program and to execute it but
choosing the best code editor or IDE is always a confusing question.
Understand that the best code editor or IDE depends on so many things such as
programming language, project type, project size, OS support and considering a
lot of other features. If we talk about Python so this language is also not an
exception.

We are going to discuss the code editor or IDEs for Python to use in 2020.
This information is going to be based on the opinion given by experienced
developers, public web data, some previous surveys like Python Developers
Survey 2018 Results / Editors and IDEs and the most important person **Guido
van Rossum** (Python Creator). Firstly understand that IDE and code editor
both are different things.

  *  **Text/Code Editor:** Code editors are the lightweight tool that allows you to write and edit the code with some features such as syntax highlighting and code formatting. It provided fewer features than IDE.
  *  **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** IDEs are full-fledged environment which provide all the essential tools needed for software development. It just doesn’t handle the code (for example, write, edit, syntax highlighting and auto-completion) but also provides other features such as debugging, execution, testing, and code formatting that helps programmers.

Let’s start with some overview of the best code editor based on certain terms…

 **What is Your Level?**

  

  

  *  **Beginner** — IDLE (or Online Python Editors) is perfect choice for the first steps in python language. PyCharm is also good but takes the help of some experienced person while using this.
  *  **Intermediate** — PyCharm, Sublime, Atom, Vs Code.
  *  **Advanced** — PyCharm, Vim, Emacs, Sublime, Atom, Vs Code.

 **What’s Your End Goal?**

  *  **Web development** — PyCharm Professional, VS Code
  *  **Data Science** — Spyder, Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm Professional
  *  **Scripting** — Sublime, Atom, PyCharm Community, Eclipse + PyDev
  *  **QA** — Sublime, Atom, PyCharm Community, Jupyter Notebook

 **What is Your Environment/OS?**

  *  **Linux, macOS** — PyCharm, Sublime, Atom, Vim, Jupyter
  *  **Windows** — Sublime, VS Code, Eclipse + PyDev, PyCharm
  *  **Multiple/mixed OS** — PyCharm, Sublime, Atom

 **Which Hardware Do You Have?**

  *  **Bad** — IDLE, Atom, Sublime, Online Editor
  *  **Good** — PyCharm, VS Code, Eclipse + PyDev

 **Note:** We have considered limited terms but it also depends on budget, git
integration, teamwork, previous programming knowledge.

### List of Best Python IDE

### 1\. PyCharm

In industries most of the professional developers use PyCharm and it has been
considered the best IDE for python developers. It was developed by the Czech
company JetBrains and it’s a cross-platform IDE. It gives daily tips to
improve your knowledge of how you can use it more efficiently which is a very
good feature. It comes in two versions community version and a professional
version where community version is free but the professional version is paid.
Below are some other features of this IDE.

  * It is considered as an intelligent code editor, fast and safe refactoring, and smart code.

### 2\. Spyder

Spyder is another good open-source and cross-platform IDE written in Python.
It is also called Scientific Python Development IDE and it is the most
lightweight IDE for Python. It is mainly used by data scientists who can
integrate with Matplotlib, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Cython, IPython, SymPy, and
other open-source software. It comes with the Anaconda package manager
distribution and it has some good advanced features such as edit, debug, and
data exploration. Below are some other features of this IDE.

  * Auto code completion and syntax highlighting.

### 4\. IDLE

IDLE is a cross-platform open-source IDE that comes by default with Python so
you don’t need to worry about the installation or setup. IDLE is written in
Python and this IDE is suitable for beginner level developers who want to
practice on python development. IDLE is lightweight and simple to use so you
can build simple projects such as web browser game automation, basic web
scraping applications, and office automation. This IDE is not good for larger
projects so move to some advance IDEs after learning the basics from IDLE.

  

  

  * Python shell with syntax highlighting
  * Call stack’s clear visibility
  * Multi-window code editor that allows features like smart indentation, autocomplete, etc
  * It has an interactive interpreter with colorizing of input, output, and error messages.

  *  **Wing Personal (Paid):** Free version that omits some features, for students and hobbyists.
  *  **Wing 101 (Paid):** A very simplified free version, for beginners in programming.

This IDE comes with a strong debugger and smart editor that makes the
interactive Python development speed, accurate and fun to perform. Some of its
main features are given below…

  * Automatic multi-process, child process, remote debug process and refactoring, etc.

### List of Best Python Code Editor

### 1\. Emacs

Emacs was created in 1976 by **Richard Stallman**. It is free and fully
customizable software available on all platforms. Emacs uses a form of the
powerful Lisp programming language for customization, and various
customization scripts exist for Python development.

  * Syntax highlighting to differentiate document elements such as keywords and comments.
  * Automatic indentation such as spaces, newlines, and brackets for consistent formatting in a file.
  * 24-bit color encoded support for the terminals supporting it.

Guido van Rossum (Python creator) accepted Emacs his favourite text editor in
one of his tweet in 2016 Emacs of course!. We also took his recent opinion
about his favorite text editor and Emacs is still his favorite one.
