numpy.delete() in Python



The **numpy.delete()** function returns a new array with the deletion of sub-
arrays along with the mentioned axis.

**Syntax:**

    
    
    numpy.delete(array, object, axis = None)

 **Parameters :**

    
    
     **array   :** [array_like]Input array. 
    **object  :** [int, array of ints]Sub-array to delete
    **axis    :** Axis along which we want to delete sub-arrays. By default, it object is applied to  
                    flattened array
    
    

**Return :**

    
    
    An array with sub-array being deleted as per the mentioned object along a given axis.
