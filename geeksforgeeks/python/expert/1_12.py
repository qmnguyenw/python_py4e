Kivy â€“ Material design Icon button



Kivy is a platform-independent GUI tool in Python. It can run on Android, IOS,
Linux and Windows, etc. This is the only GUI library from python which can
independently run on an android device even we can use it on Raspberry pi
also. It is an open-source Python library for rapid development of
applications that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch
apps. Its graphic engine is built over OpenGL ES 2 and has fast graphics
pipeline.

In this article, we will develop a GUI window using kivy framework of python,
and we will add material design icon buttons of different sizes on this
window.

 **Approach:**

  * Import required modules.
  * Create an App class.
  * Add Buttons.
  * Return layout.
  * Run an instance of the class.

 **Implementation:**
