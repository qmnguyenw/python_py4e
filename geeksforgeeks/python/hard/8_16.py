Prefix sum array in Python using accumulate function



We are given an array, find prefix sums of given array.

Examples:

    
    
    Input : arr = [1, 2, 3]
    Output : sum = [1, 3, 6]
    
    Input : arr = [4, 6, 12]
    Output : sum = [4, 10, 22]
    

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

A **prefix sum** is a sequence of partial sums of a given sequence. For
example, the cumulative sums of the sequence {a, b, c, â€¦} are a, a+b, a+b+c
and so on. We can solve this problem in python quickly using
**accumulate(iterable)** method.
