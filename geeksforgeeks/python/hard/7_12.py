Creating a dataframe from Pandas series



Series is a type of list in pandas which can take integer values, string
values, double values and more. But in Pandas Series we return an object in
the form of list, having index starting from _0_ to _n_ , Where _n_ is the
length of values in series.

Later in this article, we will discuss dataframes in pandas, but we first need
to understand the main difference between Series and Dataframe. Series can
only contain single list with index, whereas dataframe can be made of more
than one series or we can say that a dataframe is a collection of series that
can be used to analyse the data.

 **Code #1:** **Creating a simple Series**

 __  
 __  
 __

import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

 

author = ['Jitender', 'Purnima', 'Arpit', 'Jyoti']

 

auth_series = pd.Series(author)

print(auth_series)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output:**

    
    
    0    Jitender
    1     Purnima
    2       Arpit
    3       Jyoti
    dtype: object
    

**Letâ€™s check type of Series:**

import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

 

author = ['Jitender', 'Purnima', 'Arpit', 'Jyoti']

 

auth_series = pd.Series(author)

print(type(auth_series))  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output:**

    
    
    <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>
    

  
**Code #2:** **Creating Dataframe from Series**

 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

 

author = ['Jitender', 'Purnima', 'Arpit', 'Jyoti']

article = [210, 211, 114, 178]

 

auth_series = pd.Series(author)

article_series = pd.Series(article)

 

frame = { 'Author': auth_series, 'Article': article_series }

 

result = pd.DataFrame(frame)

 

print(result)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output:**

    
    
         Author  Article
    0  Jitender      210
    1   Purnima      211
    2     Arpit      114
    3     Jyoti      178
    

**Explanation:**  
We are combining two series _Author_ and _Article published_. Create a
dictionary so that we can combine the metadata for series. Metadata is the
data of data that can define the series of values. Pass this dictionary to
pandas DataFrame and finally you can see the result as combination of two
series i.e for author and number of articles.  
  
**Code #3:** **How to add series externally in dataframe**

import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

 

author = ['Jitender', 'Purnima', 'Arpit', 'Jyoti']

article = [210, 211, 114, 178]

 

auth_series = pd.Series(author)

article_series = pd.Series(article)

 

frame = { 'Author': auth_series, 'Article': article_series }

 

result = pd.DataFrame(frame)

age = [21, 21, 24, 23]

 

result['Age'] = pd.Series(age)

 

print(result)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output:**

    
    
         Author  Article  Age
    0  Jitender      210   21
    1   Purnima      211   21
    2     Arpit      114   24
    3     Jyoti      178   23
    

**Explanation:**  
We have added one more series externally named as _age_ of the authors, then
directly added this series in the pandas dataframe. Remember one thing if any
value is missing then by default it will be converted into NaN value i.e
_null_ by default.  
  
**Code #4:** **Missing value in dataframe**

import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

 

author = ['Jitender', 'Purnima', 'Arpit', 'Jyoti']

article = [210, 211, 114, 178]

 

auth_series = pd.Series(author)

article_series = pd.Series(article)

 

frame = { 'Author': auth_series, 'Article': article_series }

 

result = pd.DataFrame(frame)

age = [21, 21, 23]

 

result['Age'] = pd.Series(age)

 

print(result)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output:**

    
    
         Author  Article   Age
    0  Jitender      210  21.0
    1   Purnima      211  21.0
    2     Arpit      114  23.0
    3     Jyoti      178   NaN
    

  
**Code #5:** **Data Plot on graph**

Using plot.bar() we have created a bar graph.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

 

author = ['Jitender', 'Purnima', 'Arpit', 'Jyoti']

auth_series = pd.Series(author)

article_series = pd.Series(article)

 

frame = { 'Author': auth_series, 'Article': article_series }

 

result = pd.DataFrame(frame)

age = [21, 21, 24, 23]

 

result['Age'] = pd.Series(age)

 

result.plot.bar()

plt.show()
