numpy.ravel() in Python



The **numpy.ravel()** functions returns contiguous flattened array(1D array
with all the input-array elements and with the same type as it). A copy is
made only if needed.  
 **Syntax :**

    
    
    numpy.ravel(array, order = 'C')

 **Parameters :**

    
    
    **array :** [array_like]Input array. 
    **order :** [C-contiguous, F-contiguous, A-contiguous; optional]         
             C-contiguous order in memory(last index varies the fastest)
             C order means that operating row-rise on the array will be slightly quicker
             FORTRAN-contiguous order in memory (first index varies the fastest).
             F order means that column-wise operations will be faster. 
             â€˜Aâ€™ means to read / write the elements in Fortran-like index order if,
             array is Fortran contiguous in memory, C-like order otherwise
    

**Return :**

    
    
    Flattened array having same type as the Input array and and order as per choice. 
    

**Code 1 : Shows that array.ravel is equivalent to reshape(-1, order=order)**
