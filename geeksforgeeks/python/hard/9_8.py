Coroutine in Python



Prerequisite : Generators

We all are familiar with **function** which is also known as a **subroutine**
, **procedure** , **subprocess** etc. A function is a sequence of instructions
packed as a unit to perform a certain task. When the logic of a complex
function is divided into several self-contained steps that are themselves
functions, then these functions are called helper functions or
**subroutines**.

Subroutines in Python are called by **main function** which is responsible for
coordination the use of these subroutines. Subroutines have single entry
point.

Coroutines are generalization of subroutines. They are used for cooperative
multitasking where a process voluntarily **yield** (give away) control
periodically or when idle in order to enable multiple applications to be run
simultaneously. The difference between coroutine and subroutine is :

  * Unlike subroutines, coroutines have many entry points for suspending and resuming execution. Coroutine can suspend its execution and transfer control to other coroutine and can resume again execution from the point it left off.
  * Unlike subroutines, there is no main function to call coroutines in particular order and coordinate the results. Coroutines are cooperative that means they link together to form a pipeline. One coroutine may consume input data and send it to other which process it. Finally there may be a coroutine to display result.

 **Coroutine Vs Thread**

Now you might be thinking how coroutine is different from threads, both seems
to do same job.  
In case of threads, it’s operating system (or run time environment) that
switches between threads according to the scheduler. While in case of
coroutine, it’s the programmer and programming language which decides when to
switch coroutines. Coroutines work cooperatively multi task by suspending and
resuming at set points by programmer.

 **Python Coroutine**

In Python, coroutines are similar to generators but with few extra methods and
slight change in how we use yield statement. Generators produce data for
iteration while **coroutines can also consume data.**

In Python 2.5, a slight modification to the yield statement was introduced,
now yield can also be used as _expression_. For example on the right side of
the assignment –

    
    
    line = (yield)
    

whatever value we send to coroutine is captured and returned by **(yield)**
expression.  
A value can be send to the coroutine by **send()** method. For example,
consider this coroutine which print out name having prefix “Dear” in it. We
will send names to coroutine using send() method.

# Python3 program for demonstrating

# coroutine execution

 

def print_name(prefix):

 print("Searching prefix:{}".format(prefix))

 while True:

 name = (yield)

 if prefix in name:

 print(name)

 

# calling coroutine, nothing will happen

corou = print_name("Dear")

 

# This will start execution of coroutine and 

# Prints first line "Searchig prefix..."

# and advance execution to the first yield expression

corou.__next__()

 

# sending inputs

corou.send("Atul")

corou.send("Dear Atul")  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output:

    
    
    Searching prefix:Dear
    Dear Atul
    

**Execution of Coroutine**

  

  

Execution of coroutine is similar to the generator. When we call coroutine
nothing happens, it runs only in response to the **next()** and **send()**
method. This can be seen clearly in above example, as only after calling
**__next__()** method, out coroutine starts executing. After this call,
execution advances to the first yield expression, now execution pauses and
wait for value to be sent to _corou_ object. When first value is sent to it,
it checks for prefix and print name if prefix present. After printing name it
goes through loop until it encounters _name = (yield)_ expression again.

 **Closing a Coroutine**

Coroutine might run indefinitely, to close coroutine **close()** method is
used. When coroutine is closed it generates **GeneratorExit** exception which
can be catched in usual way. After closing coroutine, if we try to send
values, it will raise **StopIteration** exception. Following is a simple
example :

 __

 __

 __  
 __

# Python3 program for demonstrating

# closing a coroutine

 

def print_name(prefix):

 print("Searching prefix:{}".format(prefix))

 try : 

 while True:

 name = (yield)

 if prefix in name:

 print(name)

 except GeneratorExit:

 print("Closing coroutine!!")

 

corou = print_name("Dear")

corou.__next__()

corou.send("Atul")

corou.send("Dear Atul")

corou.close()  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output:

    
    
    Searching prefix:Dear
    Dear Atul
    Closing coroutine!!
    

**Chaining coroutines for creating pipeline**

Coroutines can be used to set pipes. We can chain together coroutines and push
data through pipe using send() method. A pipe needs :

    * An **initial source** (producer) which derives the whole pipe line. Producer is usually not a coroutine, it’s just a simple method.
    * A **sink** , which is the end point of the pipe. A sink might collect all data and display it.

def producer(sentence, next_coroutine):

 '''

 Producer which just split strings and

 feed it to pattern_filter coroutine

 '''

 tokens = sentence.split(" ")

 for token in tokens:

 next_coroutine.send(token)

 next_coroutine.close()

 

def pattern_filter(pattern="ing", next_coroutine=None):

 '''

 Search for pattern in received token 

 and if pattern got matched, send it to

 print_token() coroutine for printing

 '''

 print("Searching for {}".format(pattern))

 try:

 while True:

 token = (yield)

 if pattern in token:

 next_coroutine.send(token)

 except GeneratorExit:

 print("Done with filtering!!")

 

def print_token():

 '''

 Act as a sink, simply print the

 received tokens

 '''

 print("I'm sink, i'll print tokens")

 try:

 while True:

 token = (yield)

 print(token)

 except GeneratorExit:

 print("Done with printing!")

 

pt = print_token()

pt.__next__()

pf = pattern_filter(next_coroutine = pt)

pf.__next__()

 

sentence = "Bob is running behind a fast moving car"

producer(sentence, pf)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output:

    
    
    I'm sink, i'll print tokens
    Searching for ing
    running
    moving
    Done with filtering!!
    Done with printing!
