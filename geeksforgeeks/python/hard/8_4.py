Memoization using decorators in Python



Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly
till a termination condition is met. Some of the examples where recursion is
used are: calculation of fibonacci series, factorial etc. But the issue with
them is that in the recursion tree, there can be chances that the sub-problem
that is already solved is being solved again, which adds to an overhead.

Memoization is a technique of recording the intermediate results so that it
can be used to avoid repeated calculations and speed up the programs. It can
be used to optimize the programs that use recursion. In Python, memoization
can be done with the help of function decorators.

Let us take the example of calculating the factorial of a number. The simple
program below uses recursion to solve the problem:

 __

 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# Simple recursive program to find factorial

def facto(num):

 if num == 1:

 return 1

 else:

 return num * facto(num-1)

 

 

print(facto(5))  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

The above program can be optimized by memoization usingdecorators.

# Factorial program with memoization using

# decorators.

 

# A decorator function for function 'f' passed

# as parameter

def memoize_factorial(f):

 memory = {}

 

 # This inner function has access to memory

 # and 'f'

 def inner(num):

 if num not in memory: 

 memory[num] = f(num)

 return memory[num]

 

 return inner

 

@memoize_factorial

def facto(num):

 if num == 1:

 return 1

 else:

 return num * facto(num-1)

 

print(facto(5))  
  
---

Explanation:  
1\. A function called _memoize_factoria_ l has been defined. Itâ€™s main purpose
is to store the intermediate results in the variable called memory.  
2\. The second function called _facto_ is the function to calculate the
factorial. It has been annotated by a decorator(the function
memoize_factorial). The _facto_ has access to the _memory_ variable as a
result of the concept of closures.The annotation is equivalent to writing,

  

  

    
    
    facto = memoize_factorial(facto)
    

3\. When facto(5) is called, the recursive operations take place in addition
to the storage of intermediate results. Every time a calculation needs to be
done, it is checked if the result is available in _memory_. If yes, then it is
used, else, the value is calculated and is stored in _memory_.  
4\. We can verify the fact that memoization actually works, please see output
of this program.
