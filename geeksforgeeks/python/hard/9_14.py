Tracking bird migration using Python-3



One fascinating area of research uses GPS to track movements of animals. It is
now possible to manufacture a small GPS device that is solar charged, so you
don’t need to change batteries and use it to track flight patterns of birds.

The data for this case study comes from the LifeWatch INBO project. Several
data sets have been released as part of this project. We will use a small data
set that consists of migration data for three gulls named Eric, Nico, and
Sanne. The official_datasets ; used dataset – csv“>csv file
