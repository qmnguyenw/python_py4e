ML | Reinforcement Learning Algorithm : Python Implementation using Q-learning



 **Prerequisites:**Q-Learning technique.

 **Reinforcement Learning** is a type of Machine Learning paradigms in which a
learning algorithm is trained not on preset data but rather based on a
feedback system. These algorithms are touted as the future of Machine Learning
as these eliminate the cost of collecting and cleaning the data.

In this article, we are going to demonstrate how to implement a basic
Reinforcement Learning algorithm which is called the **Q-Learning technique**.
In this demonstration, we attempt to teach a bot to reach its destination
using the **Q-Learning technique**.

 **Step 1: Importing the required libraries**

 __

import numpy as np

import pylab as pl

import networkx as nx

 **Step 2: Defining and visualising the graph**

edges= [(0, 1), (1, 5), (5, 6), (5, 4),
(1, 2), 

 (1, 3), (9, 10), (2, 4), (0, 6), (6,
7),

 (8, 9), (7, 8), (1, 7), (3, 9)]

 

goal = 10

G = nx.Graph()

G.add_edges_from(edges)

pos = nx.spring_layout(G)

nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos)

nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos)

nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos)

 **Note:** The above graph may not look the same on reproduction of the code
because the networkx library in python produces a random graph from the given
edges.

 **Step 3: Defining the reward the system for the bot**

MATRIX_SIZE= 11

M = np.matrix(np.ones(shape =(MATRIX_SIZE, MATRIX_SIZE)))

M *= -1

 

for point in edges:

 print(point)

 if point[1] == goal:

 M[point] = 100

 else:

 M[point] = 0

 

 if point[0] == goal:

 M[point[::-1]] = 100

 else:

 M[point[::-1]]= 0

 # reverse of point

 

M[goal, goal]= 100

print(M)

# add goal point round trip

Now, Letâ€™s bring this bot to a more realistic setting. Let us imagine that the
bot is a detective and is trying to find out the location of a large drug
racket. He naturally concludes that the drug sellers will not sell their
products in a location which is known to be frequented by the police and the
selling locations are near the location of the drug racket. Also, the sellers
leave a trace of their products where they sell it and this can help the
detective in finding out the required location. We want to train our bot to
find the location using these **Environmental Clues**.

 **Step 6: Defining and visualizing the new graph with the environmental
clues**

# Defining the locations of the police and the drug traces

police = [2, 4, 5]

drug_traces = [3, 8, 9]

 

G = nx.Graph()

G.add_edges_from(edges)

mapping = {0:'0 - Detective', 1:'1', 2:'2 -
Police', 3:'3 - Drug traces',

 4:'4 - Police', 5:'5 - Police', 6:'6',
7:'7', 8:'Drug traces',

 9:'9 - Drug traces', 10:'10 - Drug racket location'}

 

H = nx.relabel_nodes(G, mapping)

pos = nx.spring_layout(H)

nx.draw_networkx_nodes(H, pos, node_size =[200, 200, 200,
200, 200, 200, 200, 200])

nx.draw_networkx_edges(H, pos)

nx.draw_networkx_labels(H, pos)

pl.show()

**Note:** The above graph may look a bit different from the previous graph but
they, in fact, are the same graphs. This is due to the random placement of
nodes by the networkx library.

The example taken above was a very basic one and many practical examples like
**Self Driving Cars** involve the concept of Game Theory.
