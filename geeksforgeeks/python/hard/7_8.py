Pandas | Parsing JSON Dataset



Parsing of JSON Dataset using pandas is much more convenient. Pandas allow you
to convert a list of lists into a Dataframe and specify the column names
separately.

A JSON parser transforms a JSON text into another representation must accept
all texts that conform to the JSON grammar. It may accept non-JSON forms or
extensions. An implementation may set the following:

  * limits on the size of texts that it accepts,
  * limits on the maximum depth of nesting,
  * limits on the range and precision of numbers,
  * set limits on the length and character contents of strings.

Working with large JSON datasets can be deteriorating, particularly when they
are too large to fit into memory. In cases like this, a combination of command
line tools and Python can make for an efficient way to explore and analyze the
data.

 **Importing JSON Files:**

Manipulating the JSON is done using the Python Data Analysis Library, called
pandas.

  

  

    
    
    import pandas as pd
