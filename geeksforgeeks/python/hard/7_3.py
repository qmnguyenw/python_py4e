Python – Fastest Growing Programming Language



There was a time when the word “Python” meant a particularly large snake but
now it is a programming language that is all the rage!!! According to the
TIOBE Index, Python is the fourth most popular programming language in the
world currently and this extraordinary growth is only set to increase as
observed by Stack Overflow Trends. So the question arises…Why is Python the
Fastest Growing Programming Language?

Well, there are many factors that contribute to the success of Python. One of
these is its popularity in web development. Many top companies such as Google,
Facebook, Mozilla, Quora, etc. use Python Web Framework. Another well-known
factor for the rapid growth of Python is its use in Data Science. But let’s
study all these factors in detail to understand the popularity of Python and
its astounding growth rate.

### So Why is Python So Popular?

We have already established that Python is the fastest growing programming
language and also well on the way to becoming the most popular programming
language in the world. Now, let’s try to understand the reasons for this
incredible phenomenon.

### 1\. Python is Easy To Use

Who likes excessively complicated things? No one, that’s who. And that’s one
of the reasons for the growing popularity of Python. It is simple with an
easily readable syntax and that makes it well loved by both seasoned
developers and experimental students. In addition to this, Python is also
supremely efficient. It allows developers to complete more work using fewer
lines of code. With all these advantages, what’s not to love?!!

  

  

### 2\. Python has a Supportive Community

Python has been around since 1990 and that is ample time to create a
supportive community. Because of this support, Python learners can easily
improve their knowledge, which only leads to increasing popularity. And that’s
not all! There are many resources available online to promote Python, ranging
from official documentation to YouTube tutorials that are a big help for
learners.

### 3\. Python has multiple Libraries and Frameworks

Python is already quite popular and consequently, it has hundreds of different
libraries and frameworks that can be used by developers. These libraries and
frameworks are really useful in saving time which in turn makes Python even
more popular (That’s a beneficial cycle!!!).

Some of the popular libraries of Python are NumPy and SciPy for scientific
computing, Django for web development, BeautifulSoup for XML and HTML parsing,
scikit-learn for machine learning applications, nltk for natural language
processing, etc.

### 4\. Python has Corporate Support

Did you think that a language becomes popular just like that? No….Corporate
support is a big part of it. Many top companies such as Google, Facebook,
Mozilla, Amazon, Quora, etc use Python for their products. In fact, Google has
practically adopted Python for many of its platforms and applications. It also
provides various guides and tutorials for working with Python in Google’s
Python Class.

In short, a large part of the success and growth of Python is due to the
corporate support of multiple institutions that have devoted a great deal of
money and effort to ensure the language’s success (With great results!).

### 5\. Python is used in Big Data and Machine Learning

Big Data and Machine Learning are the hottest trends in modern times. And
Python is used for much of the research and development in these fields.
Python is also crucial in related fields such as Artificial Intelligence. So
it stands to reason that this would be a huge factor in the rapid growth of
Python.

There are many Python tools for analytics and data science such as Scikit-
Learn, Theano, etc. Also, Python is used with big data using tools such as
Pandas, PySpark, etc.

### 6\. Python is used in Web Development

Python is very popular in Web development. It is easy enough to learn and yet
capable of powering some of the most popular sites in the world like Spotify,
Instagram, Pinterest, Mozilla, Yelp, etc. (It’s a win-win situation!!!).

There are many famous Web Frameworks in Python that can be used according to
the project requirements. If the project is complicated with multiple
features, it is better to use a full-stack framework such as Django, Pyramid,
TurboGears, etc. In case, the project is comparatively simpler, a
microframework such as Flask, Bottle, CherryPy, etc. is a better option.

### 7\. Python is used in Academics

When a language is taught in coursework, it has ARRIVED!

This means that Python is such a fundamental part of the programming world
currently that it is even taught in schools and colleges as a core language
requirement. This is because Python is in trend with its myriad uses in data
science, machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, etc. And
since so many of the current students are learning Python, it is obvious that
its importance will increase even more in the future.

### So what’s the Conclusion?

It is not possible to quantify the success of any language. So there is no one
reason that can be specified for the increasing popularity and astounding
growth rate of Python. However, the multiple reasons specified above coalesce
together to provide a broad picture as to why Python is such a big deal today.
