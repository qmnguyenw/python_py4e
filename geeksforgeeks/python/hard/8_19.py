WebCam Motion Detector in Python



This python program will allow you to detect motion and also store the time
interval of the motion.

 **Requirement:**

  1. Python3
  2. OpenCV(libraries)
  3. Pandas(libraries)

 **Install Requirments :** Install Python3, install Pandas and OpenCV
libraries.

 **Main Logic :** Videos can be treated as stack of pictures called frames.
Here I am comparing different frames(pictures) to the first frame which should
be static(No movements initially). We compare two images by comparing the
intensity value of each pixels. In python we can do it easily as you can see
in following code:

 **Analysis of all windows**  
After running the code there 4 new window will appear on screen. Letâ€™s analyse
it one by one:

  

  

  1.  **Gray Frame :** In Gray frame the image is a bit blur and in grayscale we did so because, In gray pictures there is only one intensity value whereas in RGB(Red, Green and Blue) image thre are three intensity values. So it would be easy to calculate the intensity difference in grayscale.

*  **Difference Frame :** Difference frame shows the difference of intensities of first frame to the current frame.

*  **Threshold Frame :** If the intensity difference for a particular pixel is more than 30(in my case) then that pixel will be white and if the difference is less than 30 that pixel will be black

*  **Color Frame :** In this frame you can see the color images in color frame along with green contour around the moving objects
