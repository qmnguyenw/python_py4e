Hex Color for Button Background â€“ Kivy



Kivy is a platform-independent GUI tool in Python. It can run on Android, IOS,
Linux and Windows, etc. This is the only GUI library from python which can
independently run on the android device even we can use it on Raspberry pi
also. It is an open-source Python library for the rapid development of multi-
touch applications. Its graphic engine is built over OpenGL and it also
supports a fast graphics pipeline.

This article focuses on creating a GUI window using kivy with a button and
then add colors to it using hex color codes.

### Approach

  * Import kivy button
  * Import kivy app
  * Import kivy builder
  * Create App class
  * Create button
  * Create mechanism to change color on click of the button
  * Return builder string
  * Run an instance of the class
