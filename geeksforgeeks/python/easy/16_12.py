Here are some of the differences between C and Python.

Python| An Imperative programming model is basically followed by C.| An
object-oriented programming model is basically followed by Python.| Variables
are declared in C.| Python has no declaration.| C doesnâ€™t have native OOP.|
Python has OOP which is a part of language.| Pointers are available in C
language.| No pointers functionality is available in Python.| C is a compiled
language.| Python is an interpreted language.| There is a limited number of
built-in functions available in C.| There is a large library of built-in
functions in Python.| Implementation of data structures requires its functions
to be explicitly implemented.| It is easy to implement data structures in
Python with built-in insert, append functions.| C is compiled direct to
machine code which is executed directly by the CPU| Python is firstly compiled
to a byte-code and then it is interpreted by a large C program.| Declaring of
variable type in C is necessary condition.| There is no need to declare a type
of variable in Python.| C does not have complex data structures.| Python has
some complex data structures.| C is statically typed.| Python is dynamically
typed.| Syntax of C is harder than python because of which programmers prefer
to use python instead of C| It is easy to learn, write and read Python
programs than C.| C programs are saved with .c extension.| Python programs are
saved by .py extension.| An assignment is allowed in a line.| Assignment gives
an error in line. For example, a=5 gives an error in python.| In C language
testing and debugging is harder.| In Python, testing and debugging is not
harder than C.| C is complex than Python.| Python is much easier than C.| The
basic if statement in c is represented as:  
if ()| The basic if statement in Python is represented as:  
if:| The basic if-else statement in Python is represented as:  
if ( )  
---  
  
  

  

elseThe basic if-else statement is represented as:  
if :

else:| C language is fast.| Python programming language is slow
