Counters in Python | Set 2 (Accessing Counters)



Counters in Python | Set 1 (Initialization and Updation)

Once initialized, counters are accessed just like dictionaries. Also, it does
not raise the KeyValue error (if key is not present) instead the valueâ€™s count
is shown as 0.

 **Example :**

 __

# Python program to demonstrate accessing of

# Counter elements

from collections import Counter

 

# Create a list

z = ['blue', 'red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'blue',
'red']

col_count = Counter(z)

print(col_count)

 

col = ['blue','red','yellow','green']

 

# Here green is not in col_count 

# so count of green will be zero

for color in col:

 print (color, col_count[color])  
  
---

 **Output:

    Counter({'blue': 3, 'red': 2, 'yellow': 1})
    blue 3
    red 2
    yellow 1
    green 0
    

**elements() :**  
The elements() method returns an iterator that produces all of the items known
to the Counter.  
Note : Elements with count <= 0 are not included.

# Python example to demonstrate elements() on

# Counter (gives back list)

from collections import Counter

 

coun = Counter(a=1, b=2, c=3)

print(coun)

 

print(list(coun.elements()))

 **Output :**

    
    
    Counter({'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1})
    ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c']
    

**most_common() :**  
most_common() is used to produce a sequence of the n most frequently
encountered input values and their respective counts.
