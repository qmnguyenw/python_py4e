How to install Python on Windows?



 **Prerequisite:** Python Language Introduction  
  
Before we start with how to install Python3 on Windows, let’s first go through
the basic introduction to Python. Python is a widely-used general-purpose,
high-level programming language. Python is a programming language that lets
you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. There are two major
Python versions- Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.

#### Getting started with Python

Python is a lot easier to code and learn. Python programs can be written on
any plain text editor like **_notepad_** , **_notepad++_** , or anything of
that sort. One can also use an online IDE for writing Python codes or can even
install one on their system to make it more feasible to write these codes
because IDEs provide a lot of features like intuitive code editor, debugger,
compiler, etc.  
To begin with, writing Python Codes and performing various intriguing and
useful operations, one must have Python installed on their System. This can be
done by following the step by step instructions provided below:

#### What if Python already exists? Let’s check

To check if your device is pre-installed with Python or not, just go to the
**Command line** (search for **cmd** in the Run dialog( __**\+ R** ).  
Now run the following command:

    
    
    python --version
    

If Python is already installed, it will generate a message with the Python
version available.
