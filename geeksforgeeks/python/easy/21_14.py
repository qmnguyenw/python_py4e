Python | Introduction to Matplotlib



Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of
arrays. Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on
NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was
introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002.

One of the greatest benefits of visualization is that it allows us visual
access to huge amounts of data in easily digestible visuals. Matplotlib
consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram etc.

 **Installation :**  
Windows, Linux and macOS distributions have matplotlib and most of its
dependencies as wheel packages. Run the following command to install
matplotlib package :

    
    
    python -mpip install -U matplotlib

  
**Importing matplotlib :**

    
    
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    _or_
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

#### Basic plots in Matplotlib :

Matplotlib comes with a wide variety of plots. Plots helps to understand
trends, patterns, and to make correlations. Theyâ€™re typically instruments for
reasoning about quantitative information. Some of the sample plots are covered
here.
