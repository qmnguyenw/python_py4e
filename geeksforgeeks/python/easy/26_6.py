Using Counter() in Python to find minimum character removal to make two
strings anagram



Given two strings in lowercase, the task is to make them Anagram. The only
allowed operation is to remove a character from any string. Find minimum
number of characters to be deleted to make both the strings anagram?  
If two strings contains same data set in any order then strings are called
**Anagrams**.

Examples:

    
    
    Input : str1 = "bcadeh" str2 = "hea"
    Output: 3
    We need to remove b, c and d from str1.
    
    Input : str1 = "cddgk" str2 = "gcd"
    Output: 2
    
    Input : str1 = "bca" str2 = "acb"
    Output: 0
    

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

This problem has existing solution please refer Remove minimum number of
characters so that two strings become anagram link. We will solve this problem
in python quickly using Counter() and Dictionary Data Structure and
**intersection** property of Set data structure. Approach is very simple,

  1. Convert each string into a dictionary data structure using **Counter(iterable)** method.
  2. Count number of keys in both dictionaries ( count1, count2) and count number of keys common in both dictionaries.
  3. If no common keys found that means we need to remove **count1 + count2** characters from both the strings.
  4. Else **(max(count1, count2) â€“ countCommon)** will be the number of characters to be removed

Alternate Solution :**

      1. Convert each string into a dictionary data structure using **Counter(iterable)** method.
      2. Find the common elements from both dictonary
      3. Add up the values from common dictionary in order to get the total number of common elements.
