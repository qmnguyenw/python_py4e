Queue in Python



Like stack, queue is a linear data structure that stores items in First In
First Out (FIFO) manner. With a queue the least recently added item is removed
first. A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where
the consumer that came first is served first.

Operations associated with queue are:  

  * **Enqueue:** Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)
  *  **Dequeue:** Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)
  *  **Front:** Get the front item from queue – Time Complexity : O(1)
  *  **Rear:** Get the last item from queue – Time Complexity : O(1)

## Implementation

There are various ways to implement a queue in Python. This article covers the
implementation of queue using data structures and modules from Python library.  
Queue in Python can be implemented by the following ways:  

  

  

  * list
  * collections.deque
  * queue.Queue

#### Implementation using list

List is a Python’s built-in data structure that can be used as a queue.
Instead of enqueue() and dequeue(), append() and pop() function is used.
However, lists are quite slow for this purpose because inserting or deleting
an element at the beginning requires shifting all of the other elements by
one, requiring O(n) time.

# Adding elements to the queue

queue.append('a')

queue.append('c')

print("Initial queue")

print(queue)

# Removing elements from the queue

print("\nElements dequeued from queue")

print(queue.pop(0))

print(queue.pop(0))

print(queue.pop(0))

print("\nQueue after removing elements")

# will raise and IndexError

# as the queue is now empty

    ['a', 'b', 'c']

    a
    b
    c
    
    Queue after removing elements
    []

        print(queue.pop(0))
    IndexError: pop from empty list
    
    
    
    

#### Implementation using collections.deque

Queue in Python can be implemented using deque class from the collections
module. Deque is preferred over list in the cases where we need quicker append
and pop operations from both the ends of container, as deque provides an O(1)
time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to list which
provides O(n) time complexity. Instead of enqueue and deque, append() and
popleft() functions are used.

        q.popleft()
    IndexError: pop from an empty deque
    
    
    
    

#### Implementation using queue.Queue

Queue is built-in module of Python which is used to implement a queue.
queue.Queue(maxsize) initializes a variable to a maximum size of maxsize. A
maxsize of zero ‘0’ means a infinite queue. This Queue follows FIFO rule.  
There are various functions available in this module:  

  * **maxsize** – Number of items allowed in the queue.
  *  **empty()** – Return True if the queue is empty, False otherwise.
  *  **full()** – Return True if there are maxsize items in the queue. If the queue was initialized with maxsize=0 (the default), then full() never returns True.
  *  **get()** – Remove and return an item from the queue. If queue is empty, wait until an item is available.
  *  **get_nowait()** – Return an item if one is immediately available, else raise QueueEmpty.
  *  **put(item)** – Put an item into the queue. If the queue is full, wait until a free slot is available before adding the item.
  *  **put_nowait(item)** – Put an item into the queue without blocking. If no free slot is immediately available, raise QueueFull.
  *  **qsize()** – Return the number of items in the queue.
