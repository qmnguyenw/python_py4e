Python | Form validation using django



 **Prerequisites** : Django Installation | Introduction to Django  
Django works on an MVT pattern. So there is a need to create data models (or
tables). For every table, a model class is created.  
Suppose there is a form that takes **Username** , **gender** , and **text** as
input from the user, the task is to validate the data and save it.  
In django this can be done, as follows:  

## Python

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

from django.db import models

# model named Post

class Post(models.Model):

 Male = 'M'

 FeMale = 'F'

 GENDER_CHOICES = (

 (Male, 'Male'),

 (FeMale, 'Female'),

 )

 # define a username filed with bound max length it can have

 username = models.CharField( max_length = 20, blank =
False,

 null = False)

 

 # This is used to write a post

 text = models.TextField(blank = False, null = False)

 

 # Values for gender are restricted by giving choices

 gender = models.CharField(max_length = 6, choices =
GENDER_CHOICES,

 default = Male)

 

 time = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add = True)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

After creating the data models, the changes need to be reflected in the
database to do this run the following command:  

    
    
    python manange.py makemigrations
    
    
    

Doing this compiles the models and if it didn’t find any errors then, it
creates a file in the migration folder. Later run the command given below to
finally reflect the changes saved onto the migration file onto the database.  

    
    
    python manage.py migrate
    
    
    

Now a form can be created. Suppose that the username length should not be less
than 5 and post length should be greater than 10. Then we define the Class
**PostForm** with the required validation rules as follows:  

  

  

## Python

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

from django.forms import ModelForm

from django import forms

from formValidationApp.models import *

# define the class of a form

class PostForm(ModelForm):

 class Meta:

 # write the name of models for which the form is made

 model = Post 

 # Custom fields

 fields =["username", "gender", "text"]

 # this function will be used for the validation

 def clean(self):

 # data from the form is fetched using super function

 super(PostForm, self).clean()

 

 # extract the username and text field from the data

 username = self.cleaned_data.get('username')

 text = self.cleaned_data.get('text')

 # conditions to be met for the username length

 if len(username) < 5:

 self._errors['username'] = self.error_class([

 'Minimum 5 characters required'])

 if len(text) <10:

 self._errors['text'] = self.error_class([

 'Post Should Contain a minimum of 10 characters'])

 # return any errors if found

 return self.cleaned_data  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Till now, the data models and the Form class are defined. Now the focus will
be on how these modules, defined above, are actually used.  
First, run on localhost through this command  

    
    
    python manage.py runserver
    
    
    

Open **http://localhost:8000/** in the browser, then it’s going to search in
the **urls.py** file, looking for ‘ ‘ path  
 **urls.py** file is as given below:  

## Python

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

from django.contrib import admin

from django.urls import path, include

from django.conf.urls import url

from django.shortcuts import HttpResponse

from . import views

urlpatterns = [

 path('', views.home, name ='index'),

]  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Basically, this associates the ‘ ‘ url with a function _ **home**_ which is
defined in **views.py** file.  
 **views.py file** :  

## Python

 __

 __

from .models import Post

from .forms import PostForm

from .import views

from django.shortcuts import HttpResponse, render, redirect

def home(request):

 # check if the request is post

 if request.method =='POST': 

 # Pass the form data to the form class

 details = PostForm(request.POST)

 # In the 'form' class the clean function

 # is defined, if all the data is correct

 # as per the clean function, it returns true

 if details.is_valid(): 

 # Temporarily make an object to be add some

 # logic into the data if there is such a need

 # before writing to the database 

 post = details.save(commit = False)

 # Finally write the changes into database

 post.save() 

 # redirect it to some another page indicating data

 # was inserted successfully

 return HttpResponse("data submitted successfully")

 

 else:

 

 # Redirect back to the same page if the data

 # was invalid

 return render(request, "home.html", {'form':details}) 

 else:

 # If the request is a GET request then,

 # create an empty form object and

 # render it into the page

 form = PostForm(None) 

 return render(request, 'home.html', {'form':form})
