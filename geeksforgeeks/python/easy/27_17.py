Underscore (_) in Python



Following are different places where _ is used in Python:

  1. Single Underscore:
    * In Interpreter
    * After a name
    * Before a name
  2. Double Underscore:
    1. __leading_double_underscore
    2. __before_after__

 **Single Underscore**

 **In Interpreter:**  
_ returns the value of last executed expression value in Python
Prompt/Interpreter

NameError: name '_' is not defined

>>> a+b

20

>>> _ * 2

>>> _

40

>>> _ / 2

20

 **For ignoring values:**  
Multiple time we do not want return values at that time assign those values to
Underscore. It used as throwaway variable.

 __

# Ignore a value of specific location/index

for _ in range(10)

 print ("Test")

 

# Ignore a value when unpacking

a,b,_,_ = my_method(var1)

 **After a name**  
Python has their by default keywords which we can not use as the variable
name. To avoid such conflict between python keyword and variable we use
underscore after name

  

  

Example:

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

>>> class MyClass():

... def __init__(self):

... print ("OWK")

 

>>> def my_defination(var1 = 1, class_ = MyClass):

... print (var1)

... print (class_)

 

>>> my_defination()

1

__main__.MyClass

>>>  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Before a name**  
Leading Underscore before variable/function/method name indicates to
programmer that It is for internal use only, that can be modified whenever
class want.

Here name prefix by underscore is treated as non-public. If specify **from
Import *** all the name starts with _ will not import. Python does not specify
truly private so this ones can be call directly from other modules if it is
specified in __all__, We also call it **weak Private**

class Prefix:

... def __init__(self):

... self.public = 10

... self._private = 12

>>> test = Prefix()

>>> test.public

10

>>> test._private

12

 **Double Underscore(__)**

 **__leading_double_underscore**  
Leading double underscore tell python interpreter to rewrite name in order to
avoid conflict in subclass.Interpreter changes variable name with class
extension and that feature known as the Mangling.

In Mangling python interpreter modify variable name with ___. So Multiple time
It use as the Private member because another class can not access that
variable directly. Main purpose for __ is to use variable/method in class only
If you want to use it outside of the class you can make public api

 **__BEFORE_AFTER__**  
Name with start with __ and ends with same considers special methods in
Python. Python provide this methods to use it as the operator overloading
depending on the user.

Python provides this convention to differentiate between the user defined
function with the moduleâ€™s function
