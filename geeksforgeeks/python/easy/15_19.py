Python vs Scala



 **Python** is a high level, interpreted and general purpose dynamic
programming language that focuses on code readability. Python requires less
typing, provides new libraries, fast prototyping, and several other new
features.  
 **Scala** is a high level language.it is a purely object-oriented programming
language. The source code of the Scala is designed in such a way that its
compiler can interpret the Java classes.

 _Below are some major differences between Python and Scala:_

Python| Scala| Python is a dynamically typed language.| Scala is a statically
typed language.| We don’t need to specify objects in Python because it is a
dynamically typed Object Oriented Programming language.| We need to specify
the type of variables and objects in Scala because Scala is statically typed
Object Oriented Programming language.| Python is easy to learn and use.| Scala
is less difficult to learn than Python.| An extra work is created for the
interpreter at the runtime.| No extra work is created in Scala and thus it is
10 times faster than Python.| The data types are decided by it during
runtime.| This is not the case in Scala that is why while dealing with large
data process, Scala should be considered instead of Python| Python’s Community
is huge compared to Scala.| Scala also has good community support. But still,
it is lesser than Python.| Python supports heavyweight process forking and
doesn’t support proper multithreading.| Scala has reactive cores and a list of
asynchronous libraries and hence Scala is a better choice for implementing
concurrency.| Its methodologies are much complex in Python as it is dynamic
programming language.| Testing is much better in scala because it is a
statically typed language.| It is popular because of its English-like syntax.|
For scalable and concurrent systems, Scala play much bigger.| Python is easy
for the developers to write code in it.| Scala is less difficult to learn than
Python and it is difficult to write code in Scala.| There is an interface in
Python to many OS system calls and libraries. It has many interpreters| It is
basically a compiled language and all source codes are compiled before
execution| Python language is highly prone to bugs whenever there is any
change to the existing code.| No such problem is seen in Scala.| Python has
libraries for Machine learning and proper data science tools and Natural
Language Processing (NLP).| Where as Scala has no such tools.| Python can be
used for small-scale projects.| Scala can be used for large-scale projects.|
It doesn’t provide scalable feature support.| It provides scalable feature
support.
