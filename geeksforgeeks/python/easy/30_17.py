Working with zip files in Python



This article explains how one can perform various operations on a zip file
using a simple python program.

 **What is a zip file?**

ZIP is an archive file format that supports lossless data compression. By
lossless compression, we mean that the compression algorithm allows the
original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. So, a
ZIP file is a single file containing one or more compressed files, offering an
ideal way to make large files smaller and keep related files together.

 **Why do we need zip files?**

  * To reduce storage requirements.
  * To improve transfer speed over standard connections.

To work on zip files using python, we will use an inbuilt python module called
zipfile.

  

  

 **1\. Extracting a zip file**

# importing required modules

from zipfile import ZipFile

 

# specifying the zip file name

file_name = "my_python_files.zip"

 

# opening the zip file in READ mode

with ZipFile(file_name, 'r') as zip:

 # printing all the contents of the zip file

 zip.printdir()

 

 # extracting all the files

 print('Extracting all the files now...')

 zip.extractall()

 print('Done!')  
  
---

The above program extracts a zip file named “my_python_files.zip” in the same
directory as of this python script.  
The output of above program may look like this:

Let us try to understand the above code in pieces:

  *     from zipfile import ZipFile

ZipFile is a class of zipfile module for reading and writing zip files. Here
we import only class ZipFile from zipfile module.

  *     with ZipFile(file_name, 'r') as zip:

Here, a ZipFile object is made by calling ZipFile constructor which accepts
zip file name and mode parameters. We create a ZipFile object in **READ** mode
and name it as **zip**.

  *     zip.printdir()

 **printdir()** method prints a table of contents for the archive.

  *     zip.extractall()

 **extractall()** method will extract all the contents of the zip file to the
current working directory. You can also call **extract()** method to extract
any file by specifying its path in the zip file.  
For example:

    
        zip.extract('python_files/python_wiki.txt')

This will extract only the specified file.

If you want to read some specific file, you can go like this:

    
        data = zip.read(name_of_file_to_read)

 **2\. Writing to a zip file**

Consider a directory (folder) with such a format:

  

  

![zip1](https://indianpythonista.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/zip1.png)

Here, we will need to crawl whole directory and its sub-directories in order
to get a list of all file-paths before writing them to a zip file.  
The following program does this by crawling the directory to be zipped:

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# importing required modules

from zipfile import ZipFile

import os

 

def get_all_file_paths(directory):

 

 # initializing empty file paths list

 file_paths = []

 

 # crawling through directory and subdirectories

 for root, directories, files in os.walk(directory):

 for filename in files:

 # join the two strings in order to form the full filepath.

 filepath = os.path.join(root, filename)

 file_paths.append(filepath)

 

 # returning all file paths

 return file_paths 

 

def main():

 # path to folder which needs to be zipped

 directory = './python_files'

 

 # calling function to get all file paths in the directory

 file_paths = get_all_file_paths(directory)

 

 # printing the list of all files to be zipped

 print('Following files will be zipped:')

 for file_name in file_paths:

 print(file_name)

 

 # writing files to a zipfile

 with ZipFile('my_python_files.zip','w') as zip:

 # writing each file one by one

 for file in file_paths:

 zip.write(file)

 

 print('All files zipped successfully!') 

 

 

if __name__ == "__main__":

 main()  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

The output of above program looks like this:  
![zip2](https://indianpythonista.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/zip2.png)

Let us try to understand above code by dividing into fragments:

  *     def get_all_file_paths(directory):
        file_paths = []
    
        for root, directories, files in os.walk(directory):
            for filename in files:
                filepath = os.path.join(root, filename)
                file_paths.append(filepath)
    
        return file_paths

First of all, to get all file paths in our directory, we have created this
function which uses the **os.walk()** method. In each iteration, all files
present in that directory are appended to a list called **file_paths**.  
In the end, we return all the file paths.

  *     file_paths = get_all_file_paths(directory)

Here we pass the directory to be zipped to the **get_all_file_paths()**
function and obtain a list containing all file paths.

  *     with ZipFile('my_python_files.zip','w') as zip:

Here, we create a ZipFile object in WRITE mode this time.

  *     for file in file_paths:
                zip.write(file)

Here, we write all the files to the zip file one by one using **write**
method.

 **3\. Getting all information about a zip file**

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# importing required modules

from zipfile import ZipFile

import datetime

 

# specifying the zip file name

file_name = "example.zip"

 

# opening the zip file in READ mode

with ZipFile(file_name, 'r') as zip:

 for info in zip.infolist():

 print(info.filename)

 print('\tModified:\t' +
str(datetime.datetime(*info.date_time)))

 print('\tSystem:\t\t' + str(info.create_system) + '(0 =
Windows, 3 = Unix)')

 print('\tZIP version:\t' + str(info.create_version))

 print('\tCompressed:\t' + str(info.compress_size) + '
bytes')

 print('\tUncompressed:\t' + str(info.file_size) + '
bytes')  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

The output of above program may look like this:

![zip4](https://indianpythonista.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/zip4.png)

    
    
    for info in zip.infolist():

Here, **infolist()** method creates an instance of **ZipInfo** class which
contains all the information about the zip file.  
We can access all information like last modification date of files, file
names, system on which files were created, Zip version, size of files in
compressed and uncompressed form, etc.
