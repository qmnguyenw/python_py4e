Python | pack() method in Tkinter



The Pack geometry manager packs widgets in rows or columns. We can use options
like **fill** , **expand** , and **side** to control this geometry manager.  
Compared to the **grid** manager, the **pack** manager is somewhat limited,
but itâ€™s much easier to use in a few, but quite common situations:

  * Put a widget inside a frame (or any other container widget), and have it fill the entire frame
  * Place a number of widgets on top of each other
  * Place a number of widgets side by side

 **Code #1:** Putting a widget inside frame and filling entire frame. We can
do this with the help of **expand** and **fill** options.

pane.pack(fill = BOTH, expand = True)

# button widgets which can also expand and fill

# in the parent widget entirely

b2 = Button(pane, text = "Click me too")

b2.pack(fill = BOTH, expand = True)

**Code #2:** Placing widgets on top of each other and side by side. We can do
this by side option.
