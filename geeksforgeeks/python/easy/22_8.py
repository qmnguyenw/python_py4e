now() function in Python



Python library defines a function that can be primarily used to get current
time and date. **_now()_** function Return the current local date and time,
which is defined under datetime module.

> Syntax : **datetime.now(tz)**
>
>  **Parameters :**  
>  **tz :** Specified time zone of which current time and date is required.
> (Uses Greenwich Meridian time by default.)
>
>  **Returns :** Returns the current date and time in time format.

#### Attributes of now() :

now() has different attributes, same as attributes of time such as year,
month, date, hour, minute, second.

 **Code #2 :** Demonstrate attributes of now().

print (current_time.day)

 

print ("Hour : ", end = "")

print ("Minute : ", end = "")

print (current_time.minute)

 

print ("Second : ", end = "")

print (current_time.second)

 

print ("Microsecond : ", end = "")

print (current_time.microsecond)

    The attributes of now() are : 
    Year : 2018
    Month : 3
    Day : 26
    Hour : 20
    Minute : 9
    Second : 4
    Microsecond : 499806

#### Getting time of particular timezone :

Sometimes, the need is just to get the current time of a particular timezone.
now() takes timezone as input to give timezone oriented output time. But these
time zones are defined in **pytz** library.

 **Code #3 :** Use of now() to handle specific timezone.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# attributes of now() for timezone

 

# for now()

import datetime

 

# for timezone()

import pytz

 

# using now() to get current time

current_time = datetime.datetime.now(pytz.timezone('Asia /
Calcutta'))

 

# printing current time in india

print ("The current time in india is : ")

print (current_time)   
  
---  
  
__

__

Output:

    
    
    The current time in india is : 
    2018-03-29 03:09:33.878000+05:30
    

**Note :** Above code wonâ€™t work on online IDE due to absence of _pytz_
module.  
  
**Application :**  
While developing any real world application, we might need to show real time
of any timezone. now() function can do the work here very efficiently and
easily.
