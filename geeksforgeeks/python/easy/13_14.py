Python | PageLayout in Kivy



Kivy is a platform independent GUI tool in Python. As it can be run on
Android, IOS, linux and Windows etc. It is basically used to develop the
Android application, but it does not mean that it can not be used on Desktops
applications.

### PageLayout:

The PageLayout works in a different manner from other layouts. It is a dynamic
layout, in the sense that it allows flipping through pages using its borders.
The idea is that its components are stacked in front of each other, and we can
just see the one that is on top.  
The PageLayout class is used to create a simple multi-page layout, in a way
that allows easy flipping from one page to another using border.

To use PageLayout you have to import it by the below command:

    
    
    from kivy.uix.pagelayout import PageLayout

 **Note:**  
PageLayout does not currently honor the size_hint, size_hint_min,
size_hint_max, or pos_hint properties.That means we can not use all these in a
page layout.

  

  

 **Basic Approach to create PageLayout:**

    
    
    1) import kivy
    2) import kivyApp
    3) import Pagelayout
    4) import button
    5) Set minimum version(optional)
    6) create App class:
            - define build() function
    7) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
    8) Run an instance of the class
    

  
**Implementation of the Approach:**

In PageLayout You can add some features on every page. We can add image,
create canvas, add color, add multiple widgets, multiple layouts  
This is how we can use the PageLayout in an efficient way. One of the best
example Our gallery Contains multiple pages.

Below is the code in which i am adding the different color to every page with
the help of get_color_from_hex
