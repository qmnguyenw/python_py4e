Garbage Collection in Python



Pythonâ€™s memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic. The user does
not have to preallocate or deallocate memory similar to using dynamic memory
allocation in languages such as C or C++.  
Python uses two strategies for memory allocation:

  * Reference counting
  * Garbage collection

Prior to Python version 2.0, the Python interpreter only used reference
counting for memory management. Reference counting works by counting the
number of times an object is referenced by other objects in the system. When
references to an object are removed, the reference count for an object is
decremented. When the reference count becomes zero, the object is deallocated.
Ex-

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# Literal 9 is an object

b = 9

 

# Reference count of object 9 

# becomes 0.

b = 4  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

The literal value 9 is an object. The reference count of object 9 is
incremented to 1 in line 1. In line 2 its reference count becomes zero as it
is dereferenced. So garbage collector deallocates the object.

A reference cycle is created when there is no way the reference count of the
object can reach. Reference cycles involving lists, tuples, instances,
classes, dictionaries, and functions are common. The easiest way to create a
reference cycle is to create an object which refers to itself as in the
example below:

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

def create_cycle():

 

 # create a list x

 x = [ ]

 

 # A reference cycle is created

 # here as x contains reference to

 # to self.

 x.append(x)

 

create_cycle()  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Because create_cycle() creates an object x which refers to itself, the object
x will not automatically be freed when the function returns. This will cause
the memory that x is using to be held onto until the Python garbage collector
is invoked.

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

x= []

x.append(l)

x.append(2)

 

# delete the list from memory or 

# assigning object x to None(Null)

del x 

# x = None  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

The reference count for the list created is now two. However, since it cannot
be reached from inside Python and cannot possibly be used again, it is
considered garbage. In the current version of Python, this list is never
freed.

 **Automatic Garbage Collection of Cycles**

Because reference cycles take computational work to discover, garbage
collection must be a scheduled activity. Python schedules garbage collection
based upon a threshold of object allocations and object deallocations. When
the number of allocations minus the number of deallocations is greater than
the threshold number, the garbage collector is run. One can inspect the
threshold for new objects (objects in Python known as generation 0 objects) by
importing the gc module and asking for garbage collection thresholds:

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# loading gc

import gc

 

# get the current collection 

# thresholds as a tuple

print("Garbage collection thresholds:",

 gc.get_threshold())  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output:

    
    
    Garbage collection thresholds: (700, 10, 10) 
    

Here, the default threshold on the above system is 700. This means when the
number of allocations vs. the number of deallocations is greater than 700 the
automatic garbage collector will run. Thus any portion of your code which
frees up large blocks of memory is a good candidate for running manual garbage
collection.

 **Manual Garbage Collection**

Invoking the garbage collector manually during the execution of a program can
be a good idea on how to handle memory being consumed by reference cycles.  
The garbage collection can be invoked manually in the following way:

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# Importing gc module

import gc

 

# Returns the number of

# objects it has collected

# and deallocated

collected = gc.collect()

 

# Prints Garbage collector 

# as 0 object

print("Garbage collector: collected",

 "%d objects." % collected)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

If few cycles are created, then how manual collection works:  
Example:

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

import gc

i = 0

 

# create a cycle and on each iteration x as a dictionary

# assigned to 1

def create_cycle():

 x = { }

 x[i+1] = x

 print x

 

# lists are cleared whenever a full collection or 

# collection of the highest generation (2) is run

collected = gc.collect() # or gc.collect(2)

print "Garbage collector: collected %d objects." % (collected)

 

print "Creating cycles..."

for i in range(10):

 create_cycle()

 

collected = gc.collect()

 

print "Garbage collector: collected %d objects." % (collected)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output:

    
    
    Garbage collector: collected 0 objects.

    Garbage collector: collected 10 objects.
    

There are two ways for performing manual garbage collection: time-based and
event-based garbage collection.  
 **Time-based** garbage collection is simple: the garbage collector is called
after a fixed time interval.  
 **Event-based** garbage collection calls the garbage collector on event
occurrence. For example, when a user exits the application or when the
application enters into idle state.
