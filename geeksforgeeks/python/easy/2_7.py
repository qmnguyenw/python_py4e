Update column value of CSV in Python



 **Prerequisites:** Pandas

In this article, we will discuss ways in which the value(s) of a column can be
updated. The best and the optimal way to update any column value of a CSV is
to use the Pandas Library and the DataFrame functions.

###  **Method 1**

 **Approach**

  * Import module
  * Open CSV file and read its data
  * Find column to be updated
  * Update value in the CSV file using to_csv() function

to_csv() **** method converts the Data Frame into CSV data as the output is
returned to the file, it takes the file object or the file name as the
parameter and the **index=False** should be mentioned so that the indices are
not written into the CSV file. But this method is very tedious and is not
reliable when you want to update similar values that are occurring multiple
times.

 **Example:**

## Python3

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# importing the pandas library

import pandas as pd

 

# reading the csv file

df = pd.read_csv("AllDetails.csv")

 

# updating the column value/data

df.loc[5, 'Name'] = 'SHIV CHANDRA'

 

# writing into the file

df.to_csv("AllDetails.csv", index=False)

 

print(df)

###  **Method 2:**

 **Approach**

  * Import module
  * Open csv file and read its data
  * Find column to be updated
  * Update value in the csv file using replace() function

The replace() method is useful when we have to update the data that is
occurring multiple number of time. We simply just have to specify the column
name and need to pass the values as a dictionary into the replace() method
which is in the form of key and value pair, the key will have the previous
data of the column and value will have the data to be updated with.

# importing the pandas library

import pandas as pd

 

# reading the csv file

df = pd.read_csv("AllDetails.csv")

 

# updating the column value/data

df['Status'] = df['Status'].replace({'P': 'A'})

 

# writing into the file

df.to_csv("AllDetails.csv", index=False)

 

print(df)

### Method 3:

In this method, we are employing csv module which is a dedicated module
centrally created for reading, writing and updating csv files.

Approach:

  * Import module
  * Read data as dictionary
  * Update the required column values storing it as a list of dictionary
  * Inserting it back, row by row
  * Closing the file.

import csv

 

op = open("AllDetails.csv", "r")

dt = csv.DictReader(op)

print(dt)

up_dt = []

for r in dt:

 print(r)

 row = {'Sno': r['Sno'],

 'Registration Number': r['Registration Number'],

 'Name': r['Name'],

 'RollNo': r['RollNo'],

 'Status': 'P'}

 up_dt.append(row)

print(up_dt)

op.close()

op = open("AllDetails.csv", "w", newline='')

headers = ['Sno', 'Registration Number', 'Name',
'RollNo', 'Status']

data = csv.DictWriter(op, delimiter=',', fieldnames=headers)

data.writerow(dict((heads, heads) for heads in headers))

data.writerows(up_dt)

 

op.close()
