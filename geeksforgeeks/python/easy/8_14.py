Python MySQL â€“ Delete Query



Python Database API ( Application Program Interface ) is the Database
interface for the standard Python. This standard is adhered to by most Python
Database interfaces. There are various Database servers supported by Python
Databases such as MySQL, GadFly, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server 2000,
Informix, Interbase, Oracle, Sybase, etc. To connect with MySQL database
server from Python, we need to import the mysql.connector interface.

Below is a program to connect with MySQL database geeks.

 __  
 __  
 __

# importing required library

import mysql.connector

 

# connecting to the database 

dataBase = mysql.connector.connect(

 host = "localhost",

 user = "user",

 passwd = "pswrd",

 database = "geeks" ) 

 

# preparing a cursor object 

cursorObject = dataBase.cursor() 

 

 

# disconnecting from server

dataBase.close()   
  
---

The above program illustrates the connection with the MySQL databasegeeks in
which host-name is localhost, the username is user and password is
pswrd.

### Deleting query from tables

After connecting with the database in MySQL we can create tables in it and can
manipulate them.

 **Syntax Statement:**

  

  

    
    
    DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE ATTRIBUTE_NAME = ATTRIBUTE_VALUE
    

**Example 1:** Below is a program to delete a query from the table in the
database.

 __

 __

 __

# importing required library

import mysql.connector 

 

# connecting to the database 

dataBase = mysql.connector.connect(

 host = "localhost",

 user = "user",

 passwd = "pswrd",

 database = "geeks" ) 

 

# preparing a cursor object 

cursorObject = dataBase.cursor() 

 

# creating table 

studentRecord = """CREATE TABLE STUDENT ( 

 NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, 

 BRANCH VARCHAR(50), 

 ROLL INT NOT NULL,

 SECTION VARCHAR(5), 

 AGE INT

 )"""

 

# table created

cursorObject.execute(studentRecord) 

 

# inserting data into the table

query = "INSERT INTO STUDENT (NAME, BRANCH, ROLL, SECTION, AGE) VALUES (%
s, % s)"

 

attrValues = ("Rituraj Saha", "Information Technology",
"1706256", "IT-3", "20")

cursorObject.execute(query, attrValues)

 

attrValues = ("Ritam Barik", "Information Technology",
"1706254", "IT-3", "21")

cursorObject.execute(query, attrValues)

 

attrValues = ("Rishi Kumar", "Information Technology",
"1706253", "IT-3", "21")

cursorObject.execute(query, attrValues)

 

# deleting query

query = "DELETE FROM STUDENT WHERE ROLL = 1706256"

cursorObject.execute(query, attrValues)

 

dataBase.commit()

 

# disconnecting from server

dataBase.close()  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output:**

![python-mysql-delete](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-

In the above program, a table named STUDENT is created having attributes
NAME, BRANCH, ROLL, SECTION and AGE. Multiple data is inserted into
the STUDENT table and then a single query is deleted from the the table
having the ROLL attribute value 1706256.

 **Example 2:** Let us look at another example for queries in a table.

 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# importing required library

import mysql.connector

 

# connecting to the database 

dataBase = mysql.connector.connect(

 host = "localhost",

 user = "user",

 passwd = "pswrd",

 database = "geeks" ) 

 

# preparing a cursor object 

cursorObject = dataBase.cursor() 

 

# drop table if it already exists 

cursorObject.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS PHONE_RECORD")

 

# creating table 

phoneRecord = """CREATE TABLE PHONE_RECORD ( 

 NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, 

 PHONE VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL

 )"""

 

# table created

cursorObject.execute(phoneRecord) 

 

# inserting data into the table

query = "INSERT INTO PHONE_RECORD (NAME, PHONE) VALUES (% s, % s)"

attrValues = ("Rituraj Saha", "9163089075")

cursorObject.execute(query, attrValues)

 

# deleting query

query = "DELETE FROM STUDENT WHERE NAME = 'Rituraj Saha'"

cursorObject.execute(query)

 

dataBase.commit()

 

# disconnecting from server

dataBase.close()  
  
---

 **Output:**

![PYTHON-MYSQL-DELETE1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-
content/uploads/20200302173433/PYTHON-MYSQL-DELETE1.png)

In the above program, another table is created in the geeks database named
PHONE_RECORD having attribute NAME and PHONE. Only one column is
inserted into the table and then it is deleted using the DELETE statement.
