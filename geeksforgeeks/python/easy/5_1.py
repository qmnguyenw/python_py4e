Access Relation Databases with Python



Databases are powerful tools for data scientists. **DB-API** is Pythonâ€™s
standard API used for accessing databases. It allows you to write a single
program that works with multiple kinds of relational databases instead of
writing a separate program for each one. This is how a typical user accesses
databases using Python code written on a Jupyter notebook, a Web-based editor.

There is a mechanism by which the Python program communicates with the DBMS:

  * The application program begins its database access with one or more API calls that connect the program to the DBMS.
  * Then to send the SQL statement to the DBMS, the program builds the statement as a text string and then makes an API call to pass the contents to the DBMS.
  * The application program makes API calls to check the status of its DBMS request and to handle errors.
  * The application program ends its database access with an API call that disconnects it from the database.

The two main concepts in the Python DB-API are:

  

  

 **1) Connection objects used for**

  * Connect to a database
  * Manage your transactions.

 **Following are a few connection methods:**

  *  **cursor()** : This method returns a new cursor object using the connection.
  *  **commit()** : This method is used to commit any pending transaction to the database.
  *  **rollback()** : This method causes the database to roll back to the start of any pending transaction.
  *  **close()** : This method is used to close a database connection.

 **2) Query objects are used to run queries.**

This is a python application that uses the DB-API to query a database.

# Create connection object

connection = connect('databasename', 'username', 'pswd')

 

# Create a cursor object

cursor = connection.cursor()

 

# Run queries

cursor.execute('select * from mytable')

results = cursor.fetchall()

cursor.close()

  1. First, we import the database module by using the connect API from that module. To open a connection to the database, you use the **connection function** and pass in the parameters that are the database name, username, and password. The **connect function** returns the connection object.
  2. After this, we create a **cursor object** on the connection object. The cursor is used to run queries and get the results.
  3. After running the queries using the cursor, we also use the cursor to **fetch the results of the query**.
  4. Finally, when the system is done running the queries, it frees all resources by **closing the connection**. Remember that it is always important to close connections to avoid unused connections taking up resources.
