Defining Clean Up Actions in Python



Think of a task you will always want your program to do, whether it runs
perfectly or raise any kind of error. For example, We use of **try** statement
which has an optional clause ‚Äì **‚Äúfinally‚Äù** to perform clean up actions, that
must be executed under all conditions.  
 **Cleanup actions:** Before leaving the **try** statement, **‚Äúfinally‚Äù**
clause is always executed, whether any exception is raised or not. These are
clauses which are intended to define clean-up actions that must be executed
under all circumstances.  
Whenever an exception occurs and is not being handled by the **except**
clause, first **finally** will occur and then the error is raised as default
[Code 3].

 **Python Programs illustrating ‚ÄúDefining Clean Up Actions‚Äù**

 **Code 1 :** Code works normally and clean-up action is taken at the end

# Python code to illustrate

def divide(x, y):

 try:

 # Floor Division : Gives only Fractional Part as Answer

 result = x // y

 except ZeroDivisionError:

 print("Sorry ! You are dividing by zero ")

 else:

 print("Yeah ! Your answer is :", result)

 finally:

 print("I'm finally clause, always raised !! ")

 

# Look at parameters and note the working of Program

divide(3, 2)  
  
---

 **Output :**

    
    
    Yeah ! Your answer is : 1
    I'm finally clause, always raised !! 
    

  
**Code 2 :** Code raise error and is carefully handled in the **except**
clause. Note that Clean-up action is taken at the end.

 print("Yeah ! Your answer is :", result)

 finally:

 print("I'm finally clause, always raised !! ")

 

# Look at parameters and note the working of Program

divide(3, 0)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output :**

    
    
    Sorry ! You are dividing by zero 
    I'm finally clause, always raised !!
    

**Code 3 :** Code, raise error but we don‚Äôt have any **except** clause to
handle it. So, clean-up action is taken first and then the **error(by default)
is raised** by the compiler.
