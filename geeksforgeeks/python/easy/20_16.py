Python | Arithmetic operations in excel file using openpyxl



 **Prerequisite:** Reading & Writing to excel sheet using openpyxl

 **Openpyxl**is a Python library using which one can perform multiple
operations on excel files like reading, writing, arithmatic operations and
plotting graphs. Letâ€™s see how to perform different arithmatic operations
using openpyxl.

  *  **=SUM(cell1:cell2) :** Adds all the numbers in a range of cells.

# import openpyxl module

import openpyxl

 

# Call a Workbook() function of openpyxl 

# to create a new blank Workbook object

wb = openpyxl.Workbook()

 

# Get workbook active sheet 

# from the active attribute.

sheet = wb.active

 

# writing to the cell of an excel sheet

sheet['A1'] = 200

sheet['A2'] = 300

sheet['A3'] = 400

sheet['A4'] = 500

sheet['A5'] = 600

 

# The value in cell A7 is set to a formula 

# that sums the values in A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 .

sheet['A7'] = '= SUM(A1:A5)'

 

# save the file

wb.save("sum.xlsx")
