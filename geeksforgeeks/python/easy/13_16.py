Python | Linear Regression using sklearn



 **Prerequisite:** Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised
learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction
value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the
relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models
differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent
variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being
used.

This article is going to demonstrate how to use the various Python libraries
to implement linear regression on a given dataset. We will demonstrate a
binary linear model as this will be easier to visualize.

In this demonstration, the model will use Gradient Descent to learn. You can
learn about it here.

 **Step 1: Importing all the required libraries**

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

import seaborn as sns

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from sklearn import preprocessing, svm

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

**Step 2: Reading the dataset**

You can download the dataset here.

cd C:\Users\Dev\Desktop\Kaggle\Salinity

 

# Changing the file read location to the location of the dataset

df = pd.read_csv('bottle.csv')

df_binary = df[['Salnty', 'T_degC']]

 

# Taking only the selected two attributes from the dataset

df_binary.columns = ['Sal', 'Temp']

 

# Renaming the columns for easier writing of the code

df_binary.head()

 

# Displaying only the 1st rows along with the column names

**Step 3: Exploring the data scatter**

 __

 __  
 __

sns.lmplot(x="Sal", y ="Temp", data = df_binary, order =
2, ci = None)

 

# Plotting the data scatter

**Step 4: Data cleaning**

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# Eliminating NaN or missing input numbers

df_binary.fillna(method ='ffill', inplace = True)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

  
**Step 5: Training our model**

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

X= np.array(df_binary['Sal']).reshape(-1, 1)

y = np.array(df_binary['Temp']).reshape(-1, 1)

 

# Separating the data into independent and dependent variables

# Converting each dataframe into a numpy array 

# since each dataframe contains only one column

df_binary.dropna(inplace = True)

 

# Dropping any rows with Nan values

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size =
0.25)

 

# Splitting the data into training and testing data

regr = LinearRegression()

 

regr.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(regr.score(X_test, y_test))

**Step 6: Exploring our results**

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

y_pred= regr.predict(X_test)

plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color ='b')

plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color ='k')

 

plt.show()

# Data scatter of predicted values  
  
---  
  
 __

The low accuracy score of our model suggests that our regressive model has not
fitted very well to the existing data. This suggests that our data is not
suitable for linear regression. But sometimes, a dataset may accept a linear
regressor if we consider only a part of it. Let us check for that possibility.  
  
**Step 7: Working with a smaller dataset**

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

df_binary500= df_binary[:][:500]

 

# Selecting the 1st 500 rows of the data

sns.lmplot(x ="Sal", y ="Temp", data = df_binary500,

 order = 2, ci = None)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-
content/uploads/20190522140357/Capture57-300x237.png)

We can already see that the first 500 rows follow a linear model. Continuing
with the same steps as before.

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

df_binary500.fillna(method='ffill', inplace = True)

 

X = np.array(df_binary500['Sal']).reshape(-1, 1)

y = np.array(df_binary500['Temp']).reshape(-1, 1)

 

df_binary500.dropna(inplace = True)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size =
0.25)

 

regr = LinearRegression()

regr.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(regr.score(X_test, y_test))

y_pred= regr.predict(X_test)

plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color ='b')

plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color ='k')

 

plt.show()
