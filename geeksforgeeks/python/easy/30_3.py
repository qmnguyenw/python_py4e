Short Circuiting Techniques in Python



By short circuiting we mean the **stoppage of execution of boolean operation
if the truth value of expression has been determined already**. The evaluation
of expression takes place from **left to right**. In python, short circuiting
is supported by various boolean operators and functions.

 **Short Circuiting in Boolean Operators**

The chart given below gives an insight of the short circuiting of in case of
boolean expressions. Boolean operators are ordered by ascending priority.

 **or:** When the Python interpreter scans **or** expression, it takes first
statement and checks to see if it is true. If the first statement is true,
then Python returns that objectâ€™s value without checking the second statement.
The program does not bother with the second statement. If the first value is
false, only then Python checks the second value and then result is based on
second half.  
 **and:** For an **and** expression, Python uses a short circuit technique to
check if the first statement is false then the whole statement must be false,
so it returns that value. Only if the first value is true, it checks the
second statement and returns the value.  
An expression containing **and** and **or** stops execution when the truth
value of expression has been achieved. Evaluation takes place from left to
right.

# is encountered. 1 is not executed

print (0 or check() or 1)

 

# using an expression to demonstrate

# prints 1

# full expression because of "and"

print (0 or check() and 1)

**Short Circuiting in all() and any()**

Inbuilt functions all() and any() in python also support short-circuiting.
Example below would give you clear insight on how it works.

 __

# python code to demonstrate short circuiting

# using all() and any()

 

# helper function

def check(i):

 print ("geeks")

 return i

 

# using all()

# stops execution when false occurs

# tells the compiler that even if one is 

# false, all cannot be true, hence stop 

# execution further.

# prints 3 "geeks" 

print (all(check(i) for i in [1, 1, 0, 0,
3]))

 

print("\r")

 

# using any()

# stops execution when true occurs

# tells the compiler that even if one is 

# true, expression is true, hence stop 

# execution further.

# prints 4 "geeks" 

print (any(check(i) for i in [0, 0, 0, 1,
3]))  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output:

    
    
    geeks
    geeks
    geeks
    False
    
    geeks
    geeks
    geeks
    geeks
    True
    

**Short Circuiting in conditional operators**

Conditional operators also follow short circuiting as when expression result
is obtained, further execution is not required.

# python code to demonstrate short circuiting

# using conditional operators

 

# helper function

def check(i):

 print ("geeks")

 return i

 

# using conditional expressions

# since 10 is not greater than 11

# further execution is not taken place 

# to check for truth value.

print( 10 > 11 > check(3) )

 

print ("\r")

 

# using conditional expressions

# since 11 is greater than 10

# further execution is taken place 

# to check for truth value.

# return true as 11 > 3

print( 10 < 11 > check(3) )

 

 

print ("\r")

 

 

# using conditional expressions

# since 11 is greater than 10

# further execution is taken place 

# to check for truth value.

# return false as 11 < 12

print( 10 < 11 > check(12) )
