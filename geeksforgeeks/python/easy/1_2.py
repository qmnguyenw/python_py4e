One of the major reasons behind such a huge demand and usage of Python,
especially among beginners, is it’s easy to read, learn, and implement nature.
Also, the language leverages you with some prominent features such as rich
library support, easy integration with other languages, huge community
support, and many more. Other than that, Python’s remarkable compatibility
with trending tech domains like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning,
Data Science, etc. raises its demand graph among the developers a bit higher.

In simple words, if you’re a proficient Python Programmer then you don’t need
to worry about career opportunities as almost every IT giant is working with
this particular language, and considering its compatibility with upcoming
technologies – **the future of Python Developers seems more bright**. Also,
you need to know, in India, the average salary of an Entry-Level Python
Developer is **around 4-6 LPA** and it can go higher as well depending on your
skillset.

  

  

_**But…is it really that much easy to get a job as a Python Fresher…??**_

YES, but only if you will follow the right approaches and that too in a
consistent manner. Now, you must be thinking what are these right approaches,
right? Okay, let us understand it with an example – suppose there is a guy, A.
A listens from somewhere that learning Python can land him up a job
opportunity. Now, what A does is – he watches few videos on YouTube or reads
few tutorials over the web. Even his concepts don’t get cleared by doing this,
but he crams all the topics abruptly just for the sake of completing the
syllabus and getting a job.

Now, what do you think – will he be able to secure a job? Chances are more
that he won’t be able to clear a Python Developer interview. Meanwhile, if he
cracks the interview by any coincidence – then still during the job or in the
long run, he will be definitely going to face numerous difficulties.

So, now we’re going to tell you about **the right approaches and strategies
that you need to follow to get a job as a Python Fresher**. Let’s get started:

### 1\. Get Your Python Fundamentals Strong

The very first thing that an interviewer expects from you, especially when
you’re a fresher, is that the basics and fundamentals of the Python language
must be cleared to you. You’re not supposed to make any excuse at least in
this particular area! You should have a clear understanding of **Python
syntax, statements, variables & operators, control structures, functions &
modules, OOP concepts, exception handling,** and various other concepts before
going out for a Python interview. There are numerous quality courses available
over the web that can help you in this. For instance, you can prefer the
GeeksforGeeks Free Python Course For Beginners where you’ll get to learn all
the Python fundamentals free of cost.

After becoming proficient with the fundamental concepts of Python, you can opt
to ******learn advanced concepts** as well. In addition, there are various
official documents, guides, and other learning resources available that can
help you to learn and master Python effectively.

### 2\. Learn Python Frameworks

Python is widely known for providing you with a huge collection of libraries
and frameworks. Furthermore, you need to learn and get proficient with these
Python web frameworks to take a step ahead towards your goal of getting a job
as a Python fresher. There are various Python web frameworks out there such as
**Django, Flask, Web2Py,** etc. – though you don’t need to learn each and
every framework as you can opt for the ones as per your requirements and
convenience. These Python frameworks are majorly classified into 3 categories
– **Full-Stack Framework, Microframework,** and the latest one in the club,
**Asynchronous Framework.** As a beginner, you’re recommended to start with
Django as it is considered the standard framework for Python by many
developers. An adequate amount of experience with these frameworks will not
only help you to dive deeper into the Python world but will also help you to
stand out among other Python freshers.

### 3\. Build Some Relevant Projects

To be honest, only learning the Python concepts is not sufficient, and you’re
required to implement all those learnings and knowledge to get practical
exposure. And you can do the same by building several relevant Python
projects! You can start it by building several minor projects such as **Number
guessing game, Hangman Game, Website Blocker,** and many others. Also, you can
opt to **build few advanced-level projects** once you’ll learn several Python
web frameworks and other trending technologies (we’ll discuss it further in
the article). You need to know that projects indeed add much-needed value to
your resume.

Let us tell you when you build projects, it also helps you to become more
familiar and comfortable with the tools & software related to the language
such as Python IDEs, libraries, etc. Also, you can **host your projects online
or contribute to some open-source Python projects** using various renowned
platforms such as GitHub, etc. as it will help you to showcase your work
conveniently to the recruiters.

  

  

### 4\. Get Exposure to Trending Technologies Using Python

Needless to say, Python is being used with almost every latest tech trend
whether it be **Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud
Computing,** or any other. And getting exposure to these upcoming technologies
using Python will not only make you industry-ready but will also give you an
edge over others during the career opportunity for Python professionals. It
will let the recruiters know that you’re quite aware and updated with the
latest industry trends.

Other than that, it will also give you direction about your specific career
goal. For instance, if you want to make a career in Data Science then after
learning Python what you can do is learn Data Science concepts and can build
several respective projects as well. Similarly, if you’re looking forward to
building a career in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning domain – you
can work on these technologies using Python and so on…!!

In short, working with the trending technologies that are using Python will
help you to go more specific with your career goals and make you ready for the
future job market.

### 5\. Do an Internship & Grow Your Network

Just after reading this heading, many of you will definitely ignore this
approach. But honestly, this single approach can **boost your chance of
getting a job as a Python fresher by 4-5x times**. There are many benefits of
doing an internship such as it lets the employer know that you are having a
genuine interest and concern towards Python, you get some worthwhile
experience by working on real-time projects, etc.

Also, you’re required to grow your professional network – you need to know
that recruiters usually prefer those freshers who have created several
projects & done some relevant internships in the past and when they are being
referred by some of the genuine people in the industry, things become much
easier. Hence, you need to **connect with those professionals who are already
working in the same industry** in which you are aspiring to get into such as
Data Science, Machine learning, Web Development, etc.

Pretty much sure, if you’ll follow the above-mentioned approaches consistently
and genuinely – you will be able to land up a Python job as a fresher without
any hassle.

In addition, we’ve shortlisted few job profiles that you can consider as a
Python Professional – check below:
