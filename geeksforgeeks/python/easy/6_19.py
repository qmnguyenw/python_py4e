EAFP Principle in Python



EAFP is a piece of gem advice in the Python community which may not be
familiar to programmers of other communities. Quickly, **EAFP** or **_‘Easier
to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission’_** means holding an optimistic view
for the code you are working on, and if an exception is thrown catch it and
deal with it later.

It is unlike the traditional method of **LBYL** or **_‘Look Before You
Leap’_**
