Feature Encoding Techniques â€“ Machine Learning



As we all know that better encoding leads to a better model and most of the
algorithms cannot handle the categorical variables unless they are converted
into a numerical value.

 **Categorical features are generally divided into 3 types:**

  1.  **Binary:** Either/or  
 _Examples:_

    * Yes, No
    * True, False
  2.  **Ordinal:** Specific ordered Groups.  
 _Examples:_

    * low, medium, high
    * cold, hot, lava Hot
  3.  **Nominal:** Unordered Groups.  
 _Examples_

  

  

  * cat, dog, tiger
  * pizza, burger, coke
