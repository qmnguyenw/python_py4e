Program to calculate the Round Trip Time (RTT)



 **Round trip time(RTT)** is the length of time it takes for a signal to be
sent plus the length of time it takes for an acknowledgement of that signal to
be received. This time therefore consists of the propagation times between the
two point of signal.  
On the Internet, an end user can determine the RTT to and from an IP(Internet
Protocol) address by pinging that address. The result depends on various
factors :-

  * The data rate transfer of the sourceâ€™s internet connection.
  * The nature of transmission medium.
  * The physical distance between source and destination.
  * The number of nodes between source and destination.
  * The amount of traffic on the LAN(Local Area Network) to which end user is connected.
  * The number of other requests being handled by intermediate nodes and the remote server.
  * The speed with which intermediate node and the remote server function.
  * The presence of Interference in the circuit.
