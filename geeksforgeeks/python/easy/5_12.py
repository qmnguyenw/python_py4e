Mahotas â€“ Haralick features



In this article we will see how we can get the haralick features of image in
mahotas. Haralick texture features are calculated from a Gray Level Co-
occurrence Matrix, (GLCM), a matrix that counts the co-occurrence of
neighboring gray levels in the image. The GLCM is a square matrix that has the
dimension of the number of gray levels N in the region of interest (ROI). For
this we are going to use the fluorescent microscopy image from a nuclear
segmentation benchmark. We can get the image with the help of command given
below  

    
    
    mahotas.demos.nuclear_image()

Below is the nuclear_image

In order to do this we will use mahotas.features.haralick method  

> **Syntax :** mahotas.features.haralick(img)  
>  **Argument :** It takes image object as argument  
>  **Return :** It returns numpy.ndarray  
>

**Note :** The input of the this should should be the filtered image or loaded
as grey  
In order to filter the image we will take the image object which is
numpy.ndarray and filter it with the help of indexing, below is the command to
do this  

    
    
    image = image[:, :, 0]

# adding gaussian filter

nuclear = mahotas.gaussian_filter(nuclear, 4)

# setting threshold

threshed = (nuclear > nuclear.mean())

# making is labeled image

labeled, n = mahotas.label(threshed)

# showing image
