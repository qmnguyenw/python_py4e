numpy.arange() in Python



 **About :**  
 **arange([start,] stop[, step,][, dtype]) :** Returns an array with evenly
spaced elements as per the interval. The interval mentioned is half opened
i.e. [Start, Stop)  
 **Parameters :**

    
    
    **start :** [optional] start of interval range. By default start = 0
    **stop  :** end of interval range
    **step  :** [optional] step size of interval. By default step size = 1,  
    For any output out, this is the distance between two adjacent values, out[i+1] - out[i]. 
    **dtype :** type of output array
    

**Return:**

    
    
    Array of evenly spaced values.
    Length of array being generated  = **Ceil((Stop - Start) / Step)**

**Note 1:**  
These NumPy-Python programs wonâ€™t run on onlineID, so run them on your systems
to explore them.

 **Note 2:**  
The advantage of numpy.arange() over the normal in-built range() function is
that it allows us to generate sequences of numbers that are not integers. For
example

import numpy as np

 

# Printing all numbers from 1 to 2 in steps of 0.1

print(np.arange(1, 2, 0.1))

Output:

    
    
    [1.  1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9]
    

If you try it with the range() function, you get a TypeError.
