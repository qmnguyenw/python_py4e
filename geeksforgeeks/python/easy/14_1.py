Image Resizing using OpenCV | Python



Image resizing refers to the scaling of images. Scaling comes in handy in many
image processing as well as machine learning applications. It helps in
reducing the number of pixels from an image and that has several advantages
e.g. It can reduce the time of training of a neural network as more is the
number of pixels in an image more is the number of input nodes that in turn
increases the complexity of the model.  
It also helps in zooming in images. Many times we need to resize the image
i.e. either shrink it or scale up to meet the size requirements. OpenCV
provides us several interpolation methods for resizing an image.  

**Choice of Interpolation Method for Resizing â€“**

  * cv2.INTER_AREA: This is used when we need to shrink an image.
  * cv2.INTER_CUBIC: This is slow but more efficient.
  * cv2.INTER_LINEAR: This is primarily used when zooming is required. This is the default interpolation technique in OpenCV.

 **Below is the code for resizing.**

image = cv2.imread("C://gfg//tomatoes.jpg", 1)

# Loading the image

half = cv2.resize(image, (0, 0), fx = 0.1, fy = 0.1)

bigger = cv2.resize(image, (1050, 1610))

stretch_near = cv2.resize(image, (780, 540),

 interpolation = cv2.INTER_NEAREST)

Titles =["Original", "Half", "Bigger", "Interpolation
Nearest"]

images =[image, half, bigger, stretch_near]

count = 4

for i in range(count):

 plt.subplot(2, 2, i + 1)

 plt.title(Titles[i])

 plt.imshow(images[i])

plt.show()

**Note:** One thing to keep in mind while using the cv2.resize() function is
that the tuple passed for determining the size of the new image ((1050, 1610)
in this case) follows the order (width, height) unlike as expected (height,
width).
