Python Projects – Beginner to Advanced



Python has become one of the most popular languages. So getting only the
theoretical knowledge will be of no use unless and until you don’t work on
some real-time projects. Working on such projects will test your Python
knowledge and you will get some hands-on experience. Moreover, working on such
projects will help you improve your knowledge.

This article aimed at covering Python project ideas from beginners level to
advance level under each domain such as projects on GUI, projects on web
development or projects involving the real-time face, vehicle, gun, sentiment
detection, even the projects involving some automation or voice assistant and
many more exciting projects are also included.
