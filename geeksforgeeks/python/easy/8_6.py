PyQt5 â€“ How to hide the title bar of window ?



When we design the GUI (Graphical User Interface) application using PyQt5,
there exist the window. A window is a (usually) rectangular portion of the
display on a computer monitor that presents its contents (e.g., the contents
of a directory, a text file or an image) seemingly independently of the rest
of the screen. Windows are one of the elements that comprise a graphical user
interface (GUI).

In a window we can see there exist a title bar which comprises the icon and
title on the left size and on the right side there exist control button.

In this article we will see how we can hide title bar. In order to do so we
will use setWindowFlag() method and pass which belongs to the QWidget
class.

>  **Syntax :** setWindowFlag(Qt.FramelessWindowHint)
>
>  **Argument :** It takes Window type as argument.
>
>  
>
>
>  
>
>
>  **Action performed :** It removes the title bar.

 # setting the geometry of window

 self.setGeometry(100, 100, 400, 300)

 

 # creating a label widget

 # by default label will display at top left corner

 self.label_1 = QLabel('no title bar', self)

 

 # moving position

 self.label_1.move(100, 100)

 

 # setting up border and background color

 self.label_1.setStyleSheet("background-color: lightgreen;

 border: 3px solid green")

 

 # show all the widgets

 self.show()

 

 

# create pyqt5 app

App = QApplication(sys.argv)

 

# create the instance of our Window

window = Window()

# start the app

sys.exit(App.exec())
