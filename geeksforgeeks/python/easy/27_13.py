numpy.all() in Python



The **numpy.all()** function tests whether all array elements along the
mentioned axis evaluate to True.

    
    
     **Syntax:** numpy.all(array,
                        axis = None,
                        out = None,
                        keepdims = class numpy._globals._NoValue at 0x40ba726c)

 **Parameters :**

    
    
    **array    :** [array_like]Input array or object whose elements, we need to test.
    **axis     :** [int or tuple of ints, optional]Axis along which array elements 
         are evaluated.
         The default (axis = None) is to perform a logical AND over all the dimensions of the input
         array. Axis may be negative, in which case it counts from the last to the first axis.
    **out      :** [ndarray, optional]Output array with same dimensions as Input array, 
         placed with result
    **keepdmis :** [boolean, optional]If this is set to True, the axes which are 
         reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result 
         will broadcast correctly against the input array.
         If the default value is passed, then keepdims will not be passed through to the all 
         method of sub-classes of ndarray, however any non-default value will be. If the 
         sub-classes sum method does not implement keepdims any exceptions will be raised.
    

**Return :**

    
    
    A new Boolean array as per 'out' parameter
