Create a stopwatch using python



This article focus on creating a stopwatch using Tkinter in python  
 **Tkinter** : Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when
combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.
Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
Itâ€™s very easy to get started with Tkinter, here are some sample codes to get
your hands on Tkinter in python.

# creating a object 'top' as instance of class Tk

top = tkinter.Tk()

 

# This will start the blank window

top.mainloop()

 **Creating Stopwatch using Tkinter**

Now lets try to create a program using Tkinter module to create a stopwatch.  
A stopwatch is a handheld timepiece designed to measure the amount of time
elapsed from a particular time when it is activated to the time when the piece
is deactivated. A large digital version of a stopwatch designed for viewing at
a distance, as in a sports stadium, is called a stop clock. In manual timing,
the clock is started and stopped by a person pressing a button. In fully
automatic time, both starting and stopping are triggered automatically, by
sensors.

 **Required Modules:** We are only going to use Tkinter for creating GUI and
no other libraries will be used in this program.
