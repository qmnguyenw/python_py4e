numpy.reshape() in Python



The **numpy.reshape()** function shapes an array without changing data of
array.

    
    
     **Syntax:** numpy.reshape(array, shape, order = 'C')

 **Parameters :**

    
    
    **array :** [array_like]Input array
    **shape :** [int or tuples of int] e.g. if we are aranging an array with 10 elements then shaping
            it like numpy.reshape(4, 8) is wrong; we can 
    **order  :** [C-contiguous, F-contiguous, A-contiguous; optional]         
             C-contiguous order in memory(last index varies the fastest)
             C order means that operating row-rise on the array will be slightly quicker
             FORTRAN-contiguous order in memory (first index varies the fastest).
             F order means that column-wise operations will be faster. 
             â€˜Aâ€™ means to read / write the elements in Fortran-like index order if,
             array is Fortran contiguous in memory, C-like order otherwise
    
    

**Return :**

    
    
    Array which is reshaped without changing the data.

 **Output :**

    
    
    Original array : 
     [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
    
    array reshaped with 2 rows and 4 columns : 
     [[0 1 2 3]
     [4 5 6 7]]
    
    array reshaped with 4 rows and 2 columns : 
     [[0 1]
     [2 3]
     [4 5]
     [6 7]]
    
    Original array reshaped to 3D : 
     [[[0 1]
      [2 3]]
    
     [[4 5]
      [6 7]]]
