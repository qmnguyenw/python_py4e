Changing Class Members in Python



In the previous fact, we have seen that Python doesnâ€™t have static keyword.
All variables that are assigned a value in class declaration are class
variables

 _ **We should be careful when changing value of class variable**_. If we try
to change class variable using object, a new instance (or non-static) variable
for that particular object is created and this variable shadows the class
variables. Below is Python program to demonstrate the same.

# Class for Computer Science Student

class CSStudent: 

 stream = 'cse' # Class Variable 

 def __init__(self, name, roll): 

 self.name = name 

 self.roll = roll 

 

# Driver program to test the functionality 

# Creating objects of CSStudent class 

a = CSStudent("Geek", 1) 

b = CSStudent("Nerd", 2) 

 

print ("Initially")

print ("a.stream =", a.stream )

print ("b.stream =", b.stream )

 

# This thing doesn't change class(static) variable 

# Instead creates instance variable for the object 

# 'a' that shadows class member. 

a.stream = "ece"

 

print ("\nAfter changing a.stream")

print ("a.stream =", a.stream )

print ("b.stream =", b.stream )  
  
---

Output:

    
    
    Initially
    a.stream = cse
    b.stream = cse
    
    After changing a.stream
    a.stream = ece
    b.stream = cse

 _ **We should change class variables using class name only.**_
