Iterators in Python



Iterator in python is an object that is used to iterate over iterable objects
like lists, tuples, dicts, and sets. The iterator object is initialized using
the **iter()** method. It uses the **next()** method for iteration.  

  1. **__iter(iterable)__** method that is called for the initialization of an iterator. This returns an iterator object
  2.  **next ( __next__ in Python 3)** The next method returns the next value for the iterable. When we use a for loop to traverse any iterable object, internally it uses the iter() method to get an iterator object which further uses next() method to iterate over. This method raises a StopIteration to signal the end of the iteration.

# Here is an example of a python inbuilt iterator

# value can be anything which can be iterate

iterable_value = 'Geeks'

iterable_obj = iter(iterable_value)

while True:

 try:

 # Iterate by calling next

 item = next(iterable_obj)

 print(item)

 except StopIteration:

 # exception will happen when iteration will over

 break

Below is a simple Python custom iterator that creates iterator type that
iterates from 10 to a given limit. For example, if the limit is 15, then it
prints 10 11 12 13 14 15. And if the limit is 5, then it prints nothing.

In the following iterations, the for loop is internally(we canâ€™t see it) using
iterator object to traverse over the iterables
