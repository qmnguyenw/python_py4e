Automated Certificate generator using Opencv in Python



 **Prerequisites:** Introduction to OpenCV

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning,
and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation
which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, one can process
images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a
human.

Any event usually involves a lot of participants and generating handwritten
certificates for each one of them and sending them digitally is a really
tedious task. Automating this job can easily save tons of time and manual work
and thus also reducing the error rate. This Python script generates
certificates with the persons name, reading from an excel file after loading a
template certificate in the script.

Below is the implementation.

 **Certificate Template:**

# certificate

template_path = 'template12.png'

 

# Excel file containing names of 

# the participants

details_path = 'gsocOrgsList.xlsx'

 

# Output Paths

output_path = '/home/nikhil/Desktop/gfg'

 

# Setting the font size and font

# colour

font_size = 3

font_color = (0,0,0)

 

# Coordinates on the certificate where

# will be printing the name (set

# according to your own template)

coordinate_y_adjustment = 15

coordinate_x_adjustment = 7

 

# loading the details.xlsx workbook 

# and grabbing the active sheet

obj = openpyxl.load_workbook(details_path)

sheet = obj.active

 

# printing for the first 10 names in the

# excel sheet

for i in range(1,11):

 

 # grabs the row=i and column=1 cell 

 # that contains the name value of that

 # cell is stored in the variable certi_name

 get_name = sheet.cell(row = i ,column = 1)

 certi_name = get_name.value

 

 # read the certificate template

 img = cv.imread(template_path)

 

 # choose the font from opencv

 font = cv.FONT_HERSHEY_PLAIN 

 

 # get the size of the name to be

 # printed

 text_size = cv.getTextSize(certi_name, font, font_size, 10)[0]


 

 # get the (x,y) coordinates where the

 # name is to written on the template

 # The function cv.putText accepts only

 # integer arguments so convert it into 'int'.

 text_x = (img.shape[1] - text_size[0]) / 2 +
coordinate_x_adjustment 

 text_y = (img.shape[0] + text_size[1]) / 2 -
coordinate_y_adjustment

 text_x = int(text_x)

 text_y = int(text_y)

 cv.putText(img, certi_name,

 (text_x ,text_y ), 

 font,

 font_size,

 font_color, 10)

 

 # Output path along with the name of the

 # certificate generated

 certi_path = output_path + '/certi' + '.png'

 

 # Save the certificate 

 cv.imwrite(certi_path,img)
