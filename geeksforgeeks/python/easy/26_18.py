Python Dictionary Comprehension



Like List Comprehension, Python allows dictionary comprehensions. We can
create dictionaries using simple expressions.  
A dictionary comprehension takes the form **_{key: value for (key, value) in
iterable}_**

Letâ€™s see a example,lets assume we have two lists named keys and value now,

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# Python code to demonstrate dictionary

# comprehension

 

# Lists to represent keys and values

keys = ['a','b','c','d','e']

values = [1,2,3,4,5] 

 

# but this line shows dict comprehension here 

myDict = { k:v for (k,v) in zip(keys, values)} 

 

# We can use below too

# myDict = dict(zip(keys, values)) 

 

print (myDict)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output :

    
    
    {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5}

We can also make dictionary from a list using comprehension

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# Python code to demonstrate dictionary

# creation using list comprehension

myDict = {x: x**2 for x in
[1,2,3,4,5]}

print (myDict)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output :

  

  

    
    
    {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

and like,

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

sDict= {x.upper(): x*3 for x in 'coding '}

print (sDict)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output :

    
    
    {'O': 'ooo', 'N': 'nnn', 'I': 'iii', 'C': 'ccc', 'D': 'ddd', 'G': 'ggg'}

We can use Dictionary comprehensions with if and else statements and with
other expressions too. This example below maps the numbers to their cubes that
are not divisible by 4:

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# Python code to demonstrate dictionary

# comprehension using if.

newdict = {x: x**3 for x in range(10) if
x**3 % 4 == 0}

print(newdict)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output :

    
    
    {0: 0, 8: 512, 2: 8, 4: 64, 6: 216}
