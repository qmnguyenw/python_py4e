bin() in Python



Converting an decimal to binary is always an important utility that is
required in python dev projects and competitive programming as well. Having a
shorthand function to achieve this can always be handy in the situations which
require the swift conversion of it without writing a long code for same, this
is provided by â€œ **bin()** â€œ. This has been discussed in this article.

 **Naive Methods to convert decimal to binary**

 **1\. Using recursion**  

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# Function to print binary number for the

# input decimal using recursion

def decimalToBinary(n):

 

 if n > 1:

 # divide with integral result 

 # (discard remainder) 

 decimalToBinary(n//2) 

 

 

 print (n%2,end="") 

 

# Driver code

if __name__ == '__main__':

 decimalToBinary(8)

 print("\r")

 decimalToBinary(18)

 print("\r")

 decimalToBinary(7)

 print

Output :

    
    
    1000
    10010
    111
    

**2\. Using loop**

 __

# Python code to demonstrate naive method

# using loop 

 

# function returning binary string

def Binary(n):

 binary = ""

 i = 0

 while n > 0 and i<=8:

 s1 = str(int(n%2))

 binary = binary + s1

 n /= 2

 i = i+1

 d = binary[::-1]

 return d

 

print("The binary representation of 100 (using loops) is :
",end="")

print(Binary(100))  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output:

  

  

    
    
    The binary representation of 100 (using loops) is : 001100100
    

**Using bin()**

Using bin() reduces the time required to code and also removes the hassle that
you may see in the above two mentioned methods.

    
    
    **Syntax :**
    bin(a)
    **Parameters :**
    **a :** an integer to convert
    **Return Value :**
    A binary string of an integer or int object.
    **Exceptions :**
    Raises TypeError when a float value is sent in arguments.

print("The binary representation of 100 (using bin()) is :

print(Binary(100))

Output :

    
    
    The binary representation of 100 (using bin()) is : 1100100
