after creating your django project, you are confused, how to share it with
people around you. This article revolves around how you can host your django
application on pythonanywhere for free. So letâ€™s get started ..!!

### Step 1: Setup your Django Project (Local Changes)

Letâ€™s create a simple application in Django for showing the deployment.

  * Initialize your Django Project 

    
    
    django-admin startproject deploy_on_pythonanywhere
    
    

  * Open project in your editor and under settings.py make:

    
    
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
    

  * Create requirements.txt file using the command

    
    
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    
    

  * File structure of our project looks like this:

    
    
    deploy_on_pythonanywhere
    â”œâ”€â”€ db.sqlite3
    â”œâ”€â”€ deploy_on_pythonanywhere
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ asgi.py
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __pycache__
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.cpython-38.pyc
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.cpython-38.pyc
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ urls.cpython-38.pyc
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ wsgi.cpython-38.pyc
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.py
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ urls.py
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ wsgi.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ manage.py
    â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
    
    

  * Letâ€™s Start our Django Server

    
    
    cd deploy_on_pythonanywhere
    python3 manage.py runserver
