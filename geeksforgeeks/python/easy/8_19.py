Django Tutorial



Django is a Python-based web framework that allows you to quickly create
efficient web applications. It is also called batteries included framework
because Django provides built-in features for everything including Django
Admin Interface, default database – SQLlite3, etc. When you’re building a
website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user
authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for
your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc. Django gives you ready-made
components to use and that too for rapid development.
