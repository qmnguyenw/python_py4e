Multiplication of two Matrices in Single line using Numpy in Python



Matrix multiplication is an operation that takes two matrices as input and
produces single matrix by multiplying rows of the first matrix to the column
of the second matrix.In matrix multiplication make sure that the number of
rows of the first matrix should be equal to the number of columns of the
second matrix.  
 **Example:** Multiplication of two matrices by each other of size 3Ã—3.

    
    
    Input:matrix1 = ([1, 2, 3],
                     [3, 4, 5],
                     [7, 6, 4])
          matrix2 = ([5, 2, 6],
                     [5, 6, 7],
                     [7, 6, 4])
    
    Output : [[36 32 32]
              [70 60 66]
              [93 74 100]]

on to the solution.

Methods to multiply two matrices in python  
1. **Using explicit for loops:** This is a simple technique to multiply matrices but one of the expensive method for larger input data set.In this, we use nested **for** loops to iterate each row and each column.  
If matrix1 is a **n x m** matrix and matrix2 is a **m x l** matrix.

# input two matrices of size n x m

matrix1 = [[12,7,3],

 [4 ,5,6],

 [7 ,8,9]]

matrix2 = [[5,8,1],

 [6,7,3],

 [4,5,9]]

 

res = [[0 for x in range(3)] for y in
range(3)] 

 

# explicit for loops

for i in range(len(matrix1)):

 for j in range(len(matrix2[0])):

 for k in range(len(matrix2)):

 

 # resulted matrix

 res[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j]

 

print (res)

Output:

    
    
    [[114 160  60]
     [ 74  97  73]
     [119 157 112]]
    

In this program, we have used nested for loops for computation of result which
will iterate through each row and column of the matrices, at last it will
accumulate the sum of product in the result.  
2\. **Using Numpy :** Multiplication using Numpy also know as vectorization
which main aim to reduce or remove the explicit use of for loops in the
program by which computation becomes faster.  
Numpy is a build in a package in python for array-processing and
manipulation.For larger matrix operations we use numpy python package which is
1000 times faster than iterative one method.

In the above example we have used dot product and in mathematics the dot
product is an algebraic operation that takes two vectors of equal size and
returns a single number. The result is calculated by multiplying corresponding
entries and adding up those products.
