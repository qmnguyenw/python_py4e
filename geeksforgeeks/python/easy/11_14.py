Difference between Python and C#



 **C# language:**  
C# is an object-oriented programming language, is pronounced as C-Sharp. This
language was developed to compete with Java, by Microsoft under the leadership
of Anders Heijlberg and his team. There are 86 total keywords used in the C#
language. In c#, pointers are used only in unsafe mode.

 **Python:**  
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language such as object-oriented
programming and structured programming and many others. It was developed by
**Guido van Rossum** in the late 1980s. There are 33 total keywords used in
the **python 3.7**. It doesnâ€™t support pointers. It is a dynamic-type language
whereas C# is a static-type language. It is easy to learn.

### Difference between Python and C#

S.NO.| C#| Python| 1.| C# is developed by Microsoft and is available free of
cost, even for commercial purpose. The .NET ecosystem is completely open-
source & is owned by .NET Foundation which is an independent organization.|
Python is also an open-source platform and available free of cost, even for
commercial purpose.| 2.| C# supports object oriented programming, structured
programming, functional programming & many others.| While python supports
multi-paradigm programming language such as OOPs and structured programming
and many others.| 3.| C# requires .NET SDK & runtime. The .NET ecosystem
offers interop with languages like F#, VB.NET, JavaScript, Python etc.| While
it can also be integrated with .NET, C, JavaScript and java.| 4.| While
primarily a compiled language, C# also supports interactive interpreter
development environments using dotnet-interactive. You also also write C# in
Jupyter notebooks.| Python supports interactive interpreter for writing
programs.| 5.| C# multi-threading is quite easy due to the use of .NET
Framework.| While in python, multi-threading needs many process due to
**Global interpreter lock**.| 6.| There are 86 total keywords used in the C#.|
While a total of 33 keywords are used in python 3.7 .| 7.| In C#, pointers are
used only in unsafe mode.| Here, Python does not support pointers.| 8.| C# is
a static-type language.| While python language is a dynamic-type language.|
9.| In C#, variable type must be declared before use.| While in python there
is no need to declare variable type before use.| 10.| C# program files are
saved by **.cs extension**.| Whereas python program files are saved by **.py
extension**.
