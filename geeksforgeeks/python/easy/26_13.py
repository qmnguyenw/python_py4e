### How does os.walk() work in python ?

OS.walk() generate the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree
either top-down or bottom-up. For each directory in the tree rooted at
directory top (including top itself), it yields a 3-tuple (dirpath, dirnames,
filenames).

  *  ** _root :_** Prints out directories only from what you specified.
  *  ** _dirs :_** Prints out sub-directories from root.
  *  ** _files :_** Prints out all files from root and directories.
