Schedule a Python Script on PythonAnywhere



Keeping the computer on 24/7 is not practical, so if you want to execute a
Python script at a particular time every day, you probably need a computer
that is ON all the time. To make this possible, a website PythonAnywhere gives
you access to such a 24/7 computer. You can upload a Python script and
schedule it to run at a certain time every day. This availability can be
useful, for example, when you want to extract some values (e.g., weather data)
from a website and generate a text file with the value or other reports every
day.

 **To schedule, a Python script for execution on PythonAnywhere, follow these
simple steps:**

  * Sign up on here the account for Beginners is free with some T&C.;
  * Go to your Dashboard, Files, Upload a File and upload the Python file you want to schedule for execution.
  * Go to Tasks and set the time of the day you want your script to be executed and type in the name of the Python file you uploaded (e.g., myfirstpyscript.py).  
 **Note** : The time entered should be in UTC.

* Click “create” and you are done.
