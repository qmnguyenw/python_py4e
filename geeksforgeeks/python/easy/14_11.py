Python | Numpy ndarray.T



With the help of **Numpy ndarray.T** object, we can make a **Transpose** of
an array having dimension greater than or equal to 2.

> Syntax : **ndarray.T**
>
> Return : Transpose of an array

 **Example #1 :**  
In this example we can see that with the help of ndarray.T object, we are
able to transform an array.
