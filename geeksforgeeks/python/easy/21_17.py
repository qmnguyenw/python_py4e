Python | Play a video in reverse mode using OpenCV



OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a computer vision library that
contains various functions to perform operations on Images or videos.

    
    
    OpenCV's application areas include :
    
    1) Facial recognition system
    2) motion tracking
    3) Artificial neural network
    4) Deep neural network
    5) video streaming  etc.

In Python, one can use an OpenCV library named **CV2**. Python does not come
with cv2, so user needs to install it separately.

> For Windows :
>  
>  
>     pip install opencv-python
>
> For Linux :

>     sudo apt-get install python-opencv

OpenCv library can be used to perform multiple operations on videos. Letâ€™s try
to do something interesting using **CV2**
