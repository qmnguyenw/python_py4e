on to the solution.

We have existing solution for this problem please refer Find the first
repeated word in a string link. We can solve this problem quickly in python
using Dictionary data structure. Approach is simple,

  1. First split given string separated by space.
  2. Now convert list of words into dictionary using collections.Counter(iterator) method. Dictionary contains words as key and itâ€™s frequency as value.
  3. Now traverse list of words again and check which first word has frequency greater than 1.

 # first split given string separated by space 

 # into words 

 words = input.split(' ') 

 

 # now convert list of words into dictionary 

 dict = Counter(words) 

 

 # traverse list of words and check which first word
