Is it Worth to Learn Python in 2020?



Researches & reports reveal that Python is one of the most preferred languages
in this 21st century. The reason behind its back is its simplicity, huge
community, and easy inbuilt functions that help in easy learning curves.
Though the question depends upon who is asking that i.e. for a beginner
learning python makes sense because it’s easy to learn.

A lot of Tech giants companies will switch to Python as a primary programming
language because it’s easy implementation and the ability for huge library
packages has proved to be a money saver for a lot of organizations. We have
listed down some important points why you should know Python in 2020:

### **1\. High-Package Salary in IT Sectors**

As IT sectors are increasing rapidly, thus now every development related to
the programming languages sets its way in the industry. One such language is
Python. It is now the most used and trained language for developers for its
demand in the market. According to the current research, the highest salary
package of the Python developers is near approximately 82 to 85 Lakhs per
Annum.

### 2\. Easy to Learn and Execute Complex Solution

Python is a high-level scripting language which is also interpreted and
interactive. Python is designed in such a constructive way that it is highly
readable. It uses English keyword which makes it easier for students to learn
whereas other languages use syntax, punctuation, ending braces, etc. It uses
very few syntactical constructions as compared to other languages. Apart from
all these things python is an open-source language.

  

  

In python, you don’t have to compile your program before executing it and it
automatically processed at runtime. Python is an object-oriented language that
deals with real-world and precis code within objects.

### 3\. Leading Language in Data Industry

Learning Python is the first step towards Data Industry. Apart from Machine
Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence, Python is also used in
IoT(Internet of Things), Web Development, Game Development, and for creating
GUI applications also. According to recent studies, more than 85000 python
scripts and modules are available for users and it is supported by PyPI.

Data Science and Machine Learning are a very strong reason why many developers
started learning python nowadays. Because in a previous couple of years,
Machine Learning and Data science industries got a very high phenomenal
growth. Python has one of the best collections of libraries for Machine
Learning and Artificial Intelligence like TensorFlow, Pandas, PyTorch, Scikit-
Learn, Theano, Apache Spark, Keras, NumPy, Seaborn, and many more.

### **4\. Versatility and Career Advancement**

Python is such kind of a programming language that is not limited within
certain domains and disciplines. It is used in different areas including Web
Development, Statistics, ML, Data Science, and AI. It supports various
frameworks such as Flask and Django by which anyone can make web applications
very easily. Python would prove to be the best choice as it not only help you
to get a job very easily but gives us many opportunities for future career
advancement and self-growth also.

Many top organizations are using Python-like NASA, Google, Nokia, IBM, Yahoo
and many more to go. Looking at the base salary and recent job trends in past
years, I can be surely said that Python is going to be a vital language in the
coming decades.

### 5\. Applications and Job Roles

Apart from all the above-mentioned domains, Python is also used in Science and
numeric applications because of its robust nature and library functions and
packages. It is also used in Software Development, Games and 3D Graphics, Big
Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence(for ANN and CNN), Computer Vision,
Robotics, Network Programming for its frameworks and open-source resources.
Another important feature of python is a web scraping and crawling. By
becoming very proficient in Python you can apply for the post of Software
Engineer, Senior Software Engineer, Data Scientist, DevOps Engineer, and many
more in the coming days.

### 6\. Portability and Extensibility:

Python is supported by various operating systems like windows, Linux, etc. and
it supports other platforms like Solaris, play station, etc. It offers
extensible properties that help developers in performing cross-language
operations easily. Python’s extensible nature allows us to invoke C and C++
libraries and integrate Java as well. Python also helps us to automate boring
and repetitive tasks.

### 7\. Supports a Wide Range of Applications

Python supports a wide range of applications from text processing(we can write
utility within few minutes to intercept UDP messages using python module) to
World wide web to Game Development also known as “Automation” property of
python. One of the best things about python is that it is not restricted to
just one thing. If in this modern era anyone knows python and continuously
updates themselves with python features and applications then surely he can
rock in the upcoming years as python is going to be crazy in this Technical
World.

Going to learn a new language or technology always makes you worry about its
prospects and when it comes to learning a new programming language, it becomes
more complex. Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence are the
future of the IT industries. Python will be a great start to boost up your
level of knowledge. Python is the most preferred language for research
purposes also, so you have a great scope to discover further about its
applications and utility.
