Python List Comprehension and Slicing



List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create a list in python. We
can create lists just like mathematical statements and in one line only. The
syntax of list comprehension is easier to grasp.

A list comprehension generally consist of these parts :

  1. Output expression,
  2. Input sequence,
  3. A variable representing a member of the input sequence and
  4. An optional predicate part.

    
    
    For example :
    
    lst  =  [x ** 2  for x in range (1, 11)   if  x % 2 == 1] 
    
    here, x ** 2 is output expression, 
          range (1, 11)  is input sequence, 
          x is variable and   
          if x % 2 == 1 is predicate part.

 **Example 1:**

# Python program to demonstrate list comprehension in Python

 

# below list contains square of all odd numbers from 

# range 1 to 10 

odd_square = [x ** 2 for x in range(1, 11) if
x % 2 == 1] 

print (odd_square) 

 

# for understanding, above generation is same as, 

odd_square = [] 

for x in range(1, 11): 

 if x % 2 == 1: 

 odd_square.append(x**2) 

print (odd_square) 

 

# below list contains power of 2 from 1 to 8 

power_of_2 = [2 ** x for x in range(1, 9)] 

print (power_of_2) 

 

# below list contains prime and non-prime in range 1 to 50 

noprimes = [j for i in range(2, 8) for j in
range(i*2, 50, i)] 

primes = [x for x in range(2, 50) if x not in
noprimes] 

print (primes) 

 

# list for lowering the characters 

print ([x.lower() for x in ["A","B","C"]] )

 

# list which extracts number 

string = "my phone number is : 11122 !!"

 

print("\nExtracted digits") 

numbers = [x for x in string if x.isdigit()] 

print (numbers) 

 

# A list of list for multiplication table 

a = 5

table = [[a, b, a * b] for b in range(1, 11)] 

 

print("\nMultiplication Table") 

for i in table: 

 print (i)   
  
---

**Output:**

    
    
    [1, 9, 25, 49, 81]
    [1, 9, 25, 49, 81]
    [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]
    [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
    ['a', 'b', 'c']
    
    Extracted digits
    ['1', '1', '1', '2', '2']
    
    Multiplication Table
    [5, 1, 5]
    [5, 2, 10]
    [5, 3, 15]
    [5, 4, 20]
    [5, 5, 25]
    [5, 6, 30]
    [5, 7, 35]
    [5, 8, 40]
    [5, 9, 45]
    [5, 10, 50]

After getting the list, we can get a part of it using pythonâ€™s slicing
operator which has the following syntax:

  

  

    
    
    
    **[start : stop : steps]** 
    
    which means that slicing will start from index start
     will go up to **stop** in **step** of steps. 
     Default value of start is 0, stop is last index of list
     and for step it is 1 

So **[: stop]** will slice list from starting till stop index and **[start :
]** will slice list from start index till end Negative value of steps shows
right to left traversal instead of left to right traversal that is why **[: :
-1]** prints list in reverse order.

 **Example 2:**

# Let us first create a list to demonstrate slicing

# lst contains all number from 1 to 10

lst =list(range(1, 11))

print (lst)

 

# below list has numbers from 2 to 5

lst1_5 = lst[1 : 5]

print (lst1_5)

 

# below list has numbers from 6 to 8

lst5_8 = lst[5 : 8]

print (lst5_8)

 

# below list has numbers from 2 to 10

lst1_ = lst[1 : ]

print (lst1_)

 

# below list has numbers from 1 to 5

lst_5 = lst[: 5]

print (lst_5)

 

# below list has numbers from 2 to 8 in step 2

lst1_8_2 = lst[1 : 8 : 2]

print (lst1_8_2)

 

# below list has numbers from 10 to 1

lst_rev = lst[ : : -1]

print (lst_rev)

 

# below list has numbers from 10 to 6 in step 2

lst_rev_9_5_2 = lst[9 : 4 : -2]

print (lst_rev_9_5_2)

 **Output:**

    
    
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    [2, 3, 4, 5]
    [6, 7, 8]
    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    [2, 4, 6, 8]
    [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    [10, 8, 6]

We can use **filter** function to filter a list based on some condition
provided as a **lambda expression** as first argument and list as second
argument, example of which is shown below :

 **Example 3:**

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

import functools

 

# filtering odd numbers

lst = filter(lambda x : x % 2 == 1, range(1,
20))

print (list(lst))

 

# filtering odd square which are divisible by 5

lst = filter(lambda x : x % 5 == 0, 

 [x ** 2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2
== 1])

print (list(lst))

 

# filtering negative numbers

lst = filter((lambda x: x < 0), range(-5,5))

print (list(lst))

 

# implementing max() function, using

print (functools.reduce(lambda a,b: a if (a > b) else b,
[7, 12, 45, 100, 15]))  
  
---

 **Output:**

    
    
    [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
    [25]
    [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]
