Python OpenCV | cv2.imshow() method



 **OpenCV-Python** is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer
vision problems. cv2.imshow() method is used to display an image in a window.
The window automatically fits to the image size.  

> **Syntax:** cv2.imshow(window_name, image)  
>  **Parameters:**  
> **window_name:** A string representing the name of the window in which image
> to be displayed.  
> **image:** It is the image that is to be displayed.
