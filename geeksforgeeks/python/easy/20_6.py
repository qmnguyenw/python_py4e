Internal working of Python



 **Python** is an object oriented programming language like Java. Python is
called an interpreted language. Python uses code modules that are
interchangeable instead of a single long list of instructions that was
standard for functional programming languages. The standard implementation of
python is called “cpython”. It is the default and widely used implementation
of the Python.  
Python doesn’t convert its code into machine code, something that hardware can
understand. It actually converts it into something called byte code. So within
python, compilation happens, but it’s just not into a machine language. It is
into byte code and this byte code can’t be understood by CPU. So we need
actually an interpreter called the python virtual machine. The python virtual
machine executes the byte codes.
