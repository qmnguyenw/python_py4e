randint() Function in Python



 ** _randint()_** is an inbuilt function of the _random module_ in Python3.
The random module gives access to various useful functions and one of them
being able to generate random numbers, which is _randint()_.  
  
 **Syntax :**

    
    
    randint(start, end)

 **Parameters :**

    
    
     **(start, end) :** Both of them must be integer type values.

 **Returns :**

    
    
    A random integer in range [start, end] including the end points.

 **Errors and Exceptions :**

    
    
    **ValueError :** Returns a ValueError when floating
                 point values are passed as parameters.
    
    **TypeError :** Returns a TypeError when anything other than 
                numeric values are passed as parameters.

**Applications :**

The randint() function can be used to simulate a lucky draw situation.

Letâ€™s say User has participated in a lucky draw competition. The user gets
three chances to guess the number between 1 and 10. If guess is correct user
wins, else loses the competition.
