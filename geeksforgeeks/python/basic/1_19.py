Image Classification using Google’s Teachable Machine



Machine learning is a scientific field that offers computers the ability to
learn without being programmed directly. When many learners, students,
engineers, and data scientists use machine learning to create diverse projects
and goods, the application of machine learning is trendy. However, the
development of machine learning models involves high device parameters, also
the model training process can often vary from hours to days. Hence, low-end
systems can not accommodate the training of successful machine learning
models, or crucial system problems are likely to arise.

However, several Machine Learning environments are easily available on the
internet that does not need any system specification or framework
specifications and use cloud technology to train the model in the best
possible time. Some of these open-source machine learning environments are
Google Colaboratory, Kaggle Kernal, these are an excellent platform for deep
learning and machine learning applications in the cloud. Both of them are
goggle products and require the knowledge of data science in order to develop
and train models using them. However, Google introduced a new open-source
platform for training machine learning models that don’t require developers to
code i.e Goggle’s Teachable Machine.

The Google Teachable Machine is an online open-source environment which is
used to develop and train machine learning and deep learning supervised models
without using any programming language.

 **Below is the step-by-step** **approach** **on how to use the Teachable
Machine to develop and train machine learning models:**

  * Click on _Get Started_ and choose whether to open an existing project or create a new project. In-order to create a new project we have three options i.e. Image Project, Audio Project, or Pose Project. Click on the Image project.

  * Add a number of classes, rename them, and upload sample images for each class. The dataset we are going to use is COVID 19-Lung CT Scans.
