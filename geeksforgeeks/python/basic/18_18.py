CBSE Class 11 | Computer Science – Python Syllabus



(Optional for the academic year 2018-19 and mandatory for the academic year
2019-20 onwards)  
 **1\. Prerequisites :** No major prerequisites are required for this course
other than basic Mathematical skills. However, it will be helpful if the
student has a basic knowledge of Computer Applications.  
 **2\. Learning Outcomes :**

  1. Develop basic computational thinking. Learn how to reason with variables, state transitions, conditionals, and iteration.
  2. Understand the notion of data types, and higher order data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
  3. Appreciate the notion of an algorithm, and understand its structure, including how algorithms handle corner cases.
  4. Develop a basic understanding of computer systems – architecture, OS, mobile and cloud computing.
  5. Learn basic SQL programming.
  6. Learn all about cyber safety.

 **4.1 Unit 1: Programming and Computational Thinking (PCT-1) (80 Theory + 70
Practical)**  
 **Familiarization with the basics of Python programming:** a simple “hello
world” program, process of writing a program, running it, and print
statements; simple data-types: integer, float, string.  
 **Introduce the notion of a variable, and methods to manipulate it** (concept
of L-value and Rvalue even if not taught explicitly), Knowledge of data types
and operators: accepting input from the console, assignment statement,
expressions, operators and their precedence.  
 **Conditional statements:** if, if-else, if-elif-else; simple programs: e.g.:
absolute value, sort 3 numbers, and divisibility, Notion of iterative
computation and control flow : for, while, flowcharts, decision trees and
pseudo code; write a lot of programs: interest calculation, primarily testing,
and factorials.  
 **Idea of debugging:** errors and exceptions; debugging: pdb, break points.  
 **Sequence datatype:** Lists, tuples and dictionary: finding the maximum,
minimum, mean; linear search on list/tuple of numbers, and counting the
frequency of elements in a list using a dictionary. Introduce the notion of
accessing elements in a collection using numbers and names.  
 **Sorting algorithm:** bubble and insertion sort; count the number of
operations while sorting.  
 **Strings:**Strings in Python : compare, concat, substring; notion of states
and transitions using state transition diagrams.

 **4.2. Unit 2: Computer Systems and Organisation (CSO) (20 Theory + 6
Practical)**  
 **Basic computer organisation**: description of a computer system and mobile
system, CPU, memory, hard disk, I/O, battery, power.  
 **Types of software:**Types of Software – System Software, Utility Software
and Application Software  
 **Language of Bits:** bit, byte, MB, GB, TB, and PB.  
 **Boolean logic:** OR, AND, NAND, NOR, XOR, NOT, truth tables, De Morgan’s
laws Number representation: numbers in base 2, 8, 16, unsigned integers,
binary addition  
 **Strings:** ASCII, UTF8, UTF32, ISCII (Indian script code)  
 **Execution of a program:** basic flow of compilation – program binary
execution, Running a program: Notion of an operating system, idea of loading,
Interpreters (process one line at a time), difference between a compiler and
an interpreter, how an operating system runs a program, operating system as a
resource manager.  
 **Cloud Computing:** Concept of cloud computers, cloud storage
(public/private), and brief introduction to parallel computing.
