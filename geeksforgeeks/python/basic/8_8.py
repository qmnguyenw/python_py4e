Pandas is an open-source library that is made mainly for working with
relational or labeled data both easily and intuitively. It provides various
data structures and operations for manipulating numerical data and time
series. This library is built on the top of the NumPy library. Pandas is fast
and it has high-performance & productivity for users.

## History

Pandas was initially developed by Wes McKinney in 2008 while he was working at
AQR Capital Management. He convinced the AQR to allow him to open source the
Pandas. Another AQR employee, Chang She, joined as the second major
contributor to the library in 2012. Over the time many versions of pandas have
been released. The latest version of the pandas is 1.0.1

## Advantages

  * Fast and efficient for manipulating and analyzing data.
  * Data from different file objects can be loaded.
  * Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data
  * Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects
  * Data set merging and joining.
  * Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets
  * Provides time-series functionality.
  * Powerful group by functionality for performing split-apply-combine operations on data sets.
