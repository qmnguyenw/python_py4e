What are the allowed characters in Python function names?



The **user-defined** names that are given to Functions or variables are known
as Identifiers. It helps in differentiating one entity from another and also
serves as a definition of the use of that entity sometimes. As in every
programming language, there are some restrictions/ limitations for
Identifiers. So, is the case with Python, we need to take care of the
following points before using an Identifier.

 **Rules for writing Identifiers:**

  * The first and foremost restriction is that Identifiers cannot be the same as Keywords. There are special reserved keywords in every programming language that has its own meaning and these names canâ€™t be used as Identifiers in Python.

# Python program to demonstrate

# that keywords cant be used as

# identifiers

 

def calculate_sum(a, b):

 return a + b

 

x = 2

y = 5

print(calculate_sum(x,y))

 

# def and if is a keyword, so

# this would give invalid 

# syntax error

def = 12

if = 2

 

print(calculate_sum(def, if))

        def = 12   
            ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    

  * An identifier in Python cannot use any special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc.

# Python code to demostrate

# that we can't use special

# character like !,@,#,$,%.etc

# valid identifier

var1 = 46

var2 = 23

print(var1 * var2)

 

# invalid identifier, 

# will give invalid syntax error

var@ = 12

$var = 55

print(var@ * $var)

 

# even function names can't

# have special characters

def my_function%():

 print('This is a function with invalid identifier')

 

my_function%()

        var@ = 12  
             ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    

  * Apart from these restrictions, Python allows Identifiers to be a combination of lowercase letters (a to z) or uppercase letters (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_). But variable name must not be started with digits. Names like myClass, var_3, and print_to_screen, are valid examples.
