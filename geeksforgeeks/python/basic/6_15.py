How to create a COVID19 Data Representation GUI?



 **Prerequisites:** Python Requests, Python GUI â€“ tkinter  
Sometimes we just want a quick fast tool to really tell whats the current
update, we just need a bare minimum of data. Web scrapping deals with taking
some data from the web and then processing it and displaying the relevant
content in a short and crisp manner.  
**What the code is doing ?**  

  * First we are using Tkinter Library to make GUI required for our script
  * We are using requests Library to get the data from the unofficial api
  * Then we are displaying the data we need in this case its Total active cases: and confirmed cases

below is the implementation.

from tkinter import *

window = Tk()

# creating the Box

window.title("Covid-19")

# Determining the size of the Box

window.geometry('220x70')

# Including labels

lbl = Label(window,

 text ="Total active cases:-......")

lbl1 = Label(window,

 text ="Total confirmed cases:-...")

lbl.grid(column = 1, row = 0)

lbl1.grid(column = 1, row = 1)

lbl2 = Label(window, text ="")

lbl2.grid(column = 1, row = 3)

def clicked():

 # Opening the url and loading the

 # json data using json Library

 url = "https://api.covid19india.org / data.json"

 page = requests.get(url)

 data = json.loads(page.text)

 

 lbl.configure(text ="Total active cases:-"

 + data["statewise"][0]["active"])

 

 lbl1.configure(text ="Total Confirmed cases:-"

 + data["statewise"][0]["confirmed"])

 

 lbl2.configure(text ="Data refreshed")

btn = Button(window, text ="Refresh", command = clicked)

btn.grid(column = 2, row = 0)

window.mainloop()
