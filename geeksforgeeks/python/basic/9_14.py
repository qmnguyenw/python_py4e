Python | Elementwise AND in tuples



Sometimes, while working with records, we can have a problem in which we may
need to perform mathematical bitwise AND operation across tuples. This problem
can occur in day-day programming. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this
task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Usingzip() \+ generator expression**  
The combination of above functions can be used to perform this task. In this,
we perform the task of AND using generator expression and mapping index of
each tuple is done by zip().

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Elementwise AND in tuples

# using zip() + generator expression 

 

# initialize tuples 

test_tup1 = (10, 4, 6, 9) 

test_tup2 = (5, 2, 3, 3) 

 

# printing original tuples 

print("The original tuple 1 : " + str(test_tup1)) 

print("The original tuple 2 : " + str(test_tup2)) 

 

# Elementwise AND in tuples

# using zip() + generator expression 

res = tuple(ele1 & ele2 for ele1, ele2 in zip(test_tup1,
test_tup2)) 

 

# printing result 

print("The AND tuple : " + str(res))

**Output :**

    
    
    The original tuple 1 : (10, 4, 6, 9)
    The original tuple 2 : (5, 2, 3, 3)
    The AND tuple : (0, 0, 2, 1)
    

**Method #2 : Usingmap() + iand**  
The combination of above functionalities can also perform this task. In this,
we perform the task of extending logic of AND using iand and mapping is done
by map().

res = tuple(map(iand, test_tup1, test_tup2))
