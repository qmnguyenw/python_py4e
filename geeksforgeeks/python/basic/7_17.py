json.load() in Python



The full-form of JSON is JavaScript Object Notation. It means that a script
(executable) file which is made of text in a programming language, is used to
store and transfer the data. Python supports JSON through a built-in package
called json. To use this feature, we import the json package in Python
script. The text in JSON is done through quoted-string which contains the
value in key-value mapping within { }. It is similar to the dictionary in
Python.

 **Note:** For more information, refer to Working With JSON Data in Python

## json.load()

json.load() takes a file object and returns the json object. A **JSON
object** contains data in the form of key/value pair. The keys are strings and
the values are the JSON types. Keys and values are separated by a colon. Each
entry (key/value pair) is separated by a comma.

 **Syntax :**

    
    
    json.load(file_object)

 **Argument :** It takes file object as a parameter.

  

  

 **Return :** It return json object.

 **Example:** Letâ€™s suppose the JSON looks like this.

We want to read the content of this file. Below is the implementation.

Here, we have used the open() function to read the JSON file. Then, the file
is parsed using json.load() method which gives us a dictionary named data.
