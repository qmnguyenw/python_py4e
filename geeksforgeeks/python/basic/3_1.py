Facts App Using Tkinter module



This is an app that will provide us with Facts. With Python, we can make
things very easy. We have a very amazing library so that we can do it.

We just need two of the libraries and if we just combine the concept, we will
be able to make a new thing. We just have to use _tkinter_ and _randfacts_ to
do this so.

#### Module Required

  *  **Tkinter:** The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is an inbuilt module in python.
  *  **RandFacts:** Randfacts is a python library that generates random facts. You can use _randfacts.getFact()_ to return a random fun fact. Use the below command to install this module in the system.

    
    
    pip install randfacts
    

We have to import the libraries and make two buttons one for adding the facts
and one for clearing the window.

#### Step-by-step Approach:

 **Step 1)** Importing the modules.
