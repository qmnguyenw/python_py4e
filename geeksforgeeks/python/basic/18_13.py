Python dictionary with keys having multiple inputs



Prerequisite : Python-Dictionary.  
 **  
How to create a dictionary where a key is formed using inputs?**  
Let us consider an example where have an equation for three input variables,
x, y and z. We want to store values of equation for different input triplets.

 **Example 1:**

 __

 __

# Python code to demonstrate a dictionary

# with multiple inputs in a key.

import random as rn

 

# creating an empty dictionary

dict = {}

 

# Insert first triplet in dictionary

x, y, z = 10, 20, 30

dict[x, y, z] = x + y - z;

 

# Insert second triplet in dictionary

x, y, z = 5, 2, 4

dict[x, y, z] = x + y - z;

 

# print the dictionary

print(dict)

 **Example 2:** Letâ€™s get access to the keys.  
Let us consider a dictionary where longitude and latitude are the **keys** and
the place to which they belong to is the **value**.

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# dictionary containing longitude and latitude of places

places = {("19.07'53.2", "72.54'51.0"):"Mumbai", \

 ("28.33'34.1", "77.06'16.6"):"Delhi"}

 

print(places)

print('\n')

 

# Traversing dictionary with multi-keys and crearing

# different lists from it

lat = []

long = []

plc = []

for i in places:

 lat.append(i[0])

 long.append(i[1])

 plc.append(places[i[0], i[1]])

 

print(lat)

print(long)

print(plc)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Now that the keys(latitude, longitude) and values(place) are stored in a list,
we can access it easily.
