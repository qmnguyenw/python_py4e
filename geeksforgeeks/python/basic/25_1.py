Execute a String of Code in Python



Given few lines of code inside a string variable and execute the code inside
the string.

Examples:

    
    
    Input:
    code = """ a = 6+5
               print(a)"""
    Output:
    11
    Explanation:
    Mind it that "code" is a variable and
    not python code. It contains another code, 
    which we need to execute.
    
    Input:
    code = """ def factorial(num):
                   for i in range(1,num+1):
                       fact = fact*i
                   return fact
               print(factorial(5))"""
    Output:
    120
    Explanation:
    On executing the program cantoning the 
    variable in Python we must get the result 
    after executing the content of the variable.
    

Here we use the **exec()** function to solve the code contained inside a
variable. exec() function is used for the dynamic execution of Python code. It
can take a block of code containing Python statements like loops, class,
function/method definitions and even try/except block. This function doesnâ€™t
return anything. The code below solves the problem and explains the exec()
function.

 LOC = """

 fact=1

 for i in range(1,num+1):

 fact = fact*i

 return fact

print(factorial(5))

 exec(LOC)
