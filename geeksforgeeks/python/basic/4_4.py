Python â€“ Assigning Subsequent Rows to Matrix first row elements



Given a (N + 1) * N Matrix, assign each column of 1st row of matrix, the
subsequent row of Matrix.

>  **Input** : test_list = [[5, 8, 10], [2, 0, 9], [5, 4, 2], [2, 3, 9]]  
>  **Output** : {5: [2, 0, 9], 8: [5, 4, 2], 10: [2, 3, 9]}  
>  **Explanation** : 5 paired with 2nd row, 8 with 3rd and 10 with 4th
>
>  **Input** : test_list = [[5, 8], [2, 0], [5, 4]]  
>  **Output** : {5: [2, 0], 8: [5, 4]}  
>  **Explanation** : 5 paired with 2nd row, 8 with 3rd.

 **Method #1 : Using dictionary comprehension**

This is one of the ways in which this task can be performed. In this, we
iterate for rows and corresponding columns using loop and assign value list
accordingly in one-liner way using dictionary comprehension.

test_list = [[5, 8, 9], [2, 0, 9], [5, 4,
2], [2, 3, 9]]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# pairing each 1st col with next rows in Matrix

res = {test_list[0][ele] : test_list[ele + 1] for ele in
range(len(test_list) - 1)}

 

# printing result 

print("The Assigned Matrix : " + str(res))

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list : [[5, 8, 9], [2, 0, 9], [5, 4, 2], [2, 3, 9]]
    The Assigned Matrix : {5: [2, 0, 9], 8: [5, 4, 2], 9: [2, 3, 9]}
    

**Method #2 : Using zip() + list slicing + dict()**

This is yet another way in which this task can be performed. In this, we slice
elements to be first row and subsequent rows using list slicing and zip()
performs the task of required grouping. Returned
