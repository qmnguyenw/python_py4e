Minimum steps to make sum and the product of all elements of array non-zero



Given an array **arr** of **N** integers, the task is to find the minimum
steps in which the sum and product of all elements of the array can be made
non-zero. In one step any element of the array can be incremented by 1.

 **Examples:**

>  **Input:** N = 4, arr[] = {0, 1, 2, 3}  
>  **Output:** 1  
>  **Explanation:**  
>  As product of all elements of the array is zero  
> Increment the array element 0 by 1, such that array sum and product is not
> equal to zero.
>
>  **Input:** N = 4, arr[] = {-1, -1, 0, 0}  
>  **Output:** 3  
>  **Explanation:**  
>  As product of all elements of the array is zero  
> Increment the array element 2 and 3 by 1, such that array sum and product is
> not equal to zero

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Approach:** The idea is to break problem into two parts that is â€“

  

  

  1. Minimum steps required to make the array product not equal to zero.
  2. Minimum steps required to make the array sum not equal to zero.

For the product of all elements of the array not equal to zero, then every
element of the array should be non-zero and to get the array sum not equal to
zero increment any element by 1 if the array sum is zero.

 **For Example:**

    
    
    N = 4, arr[] = {0, 1, 2, 3}
    
    Iterate over the array to find,
    If there is an element that is zero.
    If yes, then increment it by 1 and also
    increment the number of steps by 1.
    
    Again, Iterate over the updated array,
    To check if the array sum is zero. 
    If the array sum of the updated array
    is zero then increment any element by 1. 
    

**Algorithm:**

  * Iterate over the array to check if there is an element which is zero, then increment the element by 1 and also increment the number of steps by 1
  * Again, Iterate over the array and find the sum of the array if the sum of the array is zero then increment any element by 1 and also increment the number of steps by 1.
