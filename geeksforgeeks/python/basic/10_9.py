Ethical Hacking with Python



As a Computer Science Engineer who encrypts the world, one should know how
Hacking activities are done. And we must stand front in protecting our world
from cybercriminals.

Being able to gain access to a system that you’re not supposed to have access
to is known as Hacking. For example, login into an email account without
authorization is considered hacking that account. Gaining access to a remote
computer without authorization is hacking that computer. So you can see that
there are a large number of ways to hack into a system and the word hacking
can refer to a number of things but the main concept is the same. Gaining
access or being able to do things that you’re not supposed to be able to do,
is considered hacking.

 **Ethical hacking:**  
To crack passwords or to steal data? No, it is much more than that. Ethical
hacking is to scan vulnerabilities and to find potential threats on a computer
or networks. An ethical hacker finds the weak points or loopholes in a
computer, web applications or network and reports them to the organization.
So, let’s explore more about Ethical Hacking step-by-step.

These are various types of hackers:

  *  **Black hat hackers:**  
Here, the organization doesn’t allow the user to test it. They unethically
enter inside the website and steal data from the admin panel or manipulate the
data. They only focus on themselves and the advantages they will get from the
personal data for personal financial gain. They can cause major damage to the
company by altering the functions which lead to the loss of the company at a
much higher extent. This can even lead you to extreme consequences.

  

  

*  **White hat hackers:**  
Here, we look for bugs and ethically report it to the organization. We are
authorized as a user to test for bugs in a website or network and report it to
them. White hat hackers generally get all the needed information about the
application or network to test for, from the organization itself. They use
their skills to test it before the website goes live or attacked by malicious
hackers.

*  **3.Grey hat hackers:**  
They sometimes access to the data and violates the law. But never have the
same intention as Black hat hackers, they often operate for the common good.
The main difference is that they exploit vulnerability publicly whereas white
hat hackers do it privately for the company.
