Python â€“ Extract records if Kth elements not in List



Given list of tuples, task is to extract all the tuples where Kth index
elements are not present in argument list.

>  **Input** : test_list = [(5, 3), (7, 4), (1, 3), (7, 8), (0, 6)], arg_list
> = [6, 8, 8], K = 1
>
>  **Output** : [(5, 3), (7, 4), (1, 3)]
>
>  **Explanation** : All the elements which have either 6 or 8 at 1st index
> are removed.
>
>  **Input** : test_list = [(5, 3), (7, 4)], arg_list = [3, 3, 3, 3], K = 1
>
>  
>
>
>  
>
>
>  **Output** : [(7, 4)]
>
>  **Explanation** : (5, 3) is removed as it has 3 at 1st index.

 **Method #1 : Using set() + loop**

This is one way in which this task can be. In this, we shorten the argument
list using set and then efficiently check for Kth index having any element
from arg. list and append accordingly.

# Using loop

 

# initializing list

test_list = [(5, 3), (7, 4), (1, 3), (7,
8), (0, 6)]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing arg. list

arg_list = [4, 8, 4]

 

# initializing K

K = 1

 

# Using set() to shorten arg list

temp = set(arg_list)

 

# loop to check for elements and append

res = []

for sub in test_list:

 if sub[K] not in arg_list:

 res.append(sub)

 

# printing result

print("Extracted elements : " + str(res))

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list : [(5, 3), (7, 4), (1, 3), (7, 8), (0, 6)]
    Extracted elements : [(5, 3), (1, 3), (0, 6)]
    
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension + set()**

This is yet another way in which this task can be performed. In this, we
compile both, task of filtering duplicates using set() and compiling elements
using conditionals inside list comprehension.
