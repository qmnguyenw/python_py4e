Python None Keyword



None is used to define a null value. It is not the same as an empty string,
False, or a zero. It is a data type of the class NoneType object.

Assigning a value of None to a variable is one way to reset it to its
original, empty state.

 **Example 1:**

## Python3

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# we will check the type of None

print(type(None))  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output**

    
    
    <class 'NoneType'>
    

**Example 2:**

  

  

## Python3

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# declaring a variable as None

var = None

 

# checking it's value

if var is None:

 print("var has a value of None")

else:

 print("var has a value")  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output**

    
    
    var has a value of None
    

**Note:** If a function does not return anything, it returns None in python.
