Python | Ways to find length of list



List being an integral part of Python day-day programming has to be learned by
all the python users and having a knowledge of its utility and operations is
essential and always a plus. So this article discusses one such utility of
finding the no. of elements in a list.

 **Method 1 : Naive Method**

In this method one just runs a loop and increases the counter till the last
element of the list to know its count. This is the most basic strategy that
can be possibly employed in the absence of other present techniques.

# Python code to demonstrate

# length of list

# using naive method

 

# Initializing list 

test_list = [ 1, 4, 5, 7, 8 ]

 

# Printing test_list

print ("The list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# Finding length of list 

# using loop

# Initializing counter

counter = 0

for i in test_list:

 

 # incrementing counter

 counter = counter + 1

 

# Printing length of list 

print ("Length of list using naive method is : " + str(counter))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The list is : [1, 4, 5, 7, 8]
    Length of list using naive method is : 5
    

**Method 2 : Usinglen()**

  

  

The len() method offers the most used and easy way to find length of any
list. This is the most conventional technique adopted by all the programmers
today.

# Python program to demonstrate working

# of len()

a = []

a.append("Hello")

a.append("Geeks")

a.append("For")

a.append("Geeks")

print("The length of list is: ", len(a))  
  
---  
  
 __

 **Output:**

    
    
    The length of list is:  4

# Python program to demonstrate working

# of len()

n = len([10, 20, 30])

print("The length of list is: ", n)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output:**

    
    
    The length of list is:  3
    

**Method 3 : Usinglength_hint()**

This technique is lesser known technique of finding list length. This
particular method is defined in operator class and it can also tell the no. of
elements present in the list.  
  
 **Code #2 :** Demonstrating finding length of list using len() and
length_hint()

# Python code to demonstrate

# length of list

# using len() and length_hint

from operator import length_hint

 

# Initializing list 

test_list = [ 1, 4, 5, 7, 8 ]

 

# Printing test_list

print ("The list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# Finding length of list 

# using len()

list_len = len(test_list)

 

# Finding length of list 

# using length_hint()

list_len_hint = length_hint(test_list)

 

# Printing length of list 

print ("Length of list using len() is : " + str(list_len))

print ("Length of list using length_hint() is : " +
str(list_len_hint))  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output :**

    
    
    The list is : [1, 4, 5, 7, 8]
    Length of list using len() is : 5
    Length of list using length_hint() is : 5
    

**Performance Analysis â€“ Naive vslen() vs length_hint()**

When while choosing amongst alternatives its always necessary to have a valid
reason why to chose one over another. This section does a time analysis of how
much time it takes to execute all of them to offer a better choice to use.

from operator import length_hint

# Printing test_list

print ("The list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# Finding length of list 

# using loop

# Initializing counter

start_time_naive = time.time()

counter = 0

for i in test_list:

 

 # incrementing counter

 counter = counter + 1

end_time_naive = str(time.time() - start_time_naive)

 

# Finding length of list 

# using len()

start_time_len = time.time()

list_len = len(test_list)

end_time_len = str(time.time() - start_time_len)

 

# Finding length of list 

# using length_hint()

start_time_hint = time.time()

list_len_hint = length_hint(test_list)

end_time_hint = str(time.time() - start_time_hint)

 

# Printing Times of each 

print ("Time taken using naive method is : " + end_time_naive)

print ("Time taken using len() is : " + end_time_len)

print ("Time taken using length_hint() is : " + end_time_hint)  
  
---

 **Output :**

    
    
    The list is : [1, 4, 5, 7, 8]
    Time taken using naive method is : 2.6226043701171875e-06
    Time taken using len() is : 1.1920928955078125e-06
    Time taken using length_hint() is : 1.430511474609375e-06
    

**Conclusion :** It can be clearly seen that time taken is **naive >>
length_hint() > len()**, hence len() is the best choice to use.
