Difference between Python and Java



 **Python:** Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It was
invented back in 1991, by Guido Van Rossum. Python is an object-oriented
programming language that has large enormous library support making the
implementation of various programs and algorithms easy. Its language
constructs and object-oriented approach aims to help programmers to write
clear, logical code for various projects.

 **Java:** Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language which
was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java
has a syntax similar to C and C++ but with low-level difficulties. Java is
platform-independent (WORA – Write Once Run Anywhere) meaning compiled java
code can run on different platforms without recompilation.

 **Python vs. Java** Parameter| Python| Java| Code| Python has less lines of
code.| Java has longer lines of code.| Framework| Compare to JAVA, Python has
lower number of Frameworks. Popular ones are DJango, Flask.| Java has large
number of Frameworks. Popular ones are Spring, Hibernate, etc.| Syntax| Syntax
is easy to remember almost similar to human language.| Syntax is complex as it
throws error if you miss semicolon or curly braces.| Key Features| Less line
no of code, Rapid deployment and dynamic typing.| Self memory management,
Robust, Platform independent| Speed| Python is slower since it uses
interpreter and also determines the data type at run time.| Java is faster in
speed as compared to python.| Databases| Python’s database access layers are
weaker than Java’s JDBC. This is why it rarely used in enterprises.|
(JDBC)Java Database Connectivity is most popular and widely used to connect
with database.| Machine Learning Libraries| Tensorflow, Pytorch.| Weka,
Mallet, Deeplearning4j, MOA| Practical Agility| Python has always had a
presence in the agile space and has grown in popularity for many reasons,
including the rise of the DevOps movement.| Java enjoys more consistent
refactoring support than Python thanks on one hand to its static type system
which makes automated refactored more predictable and reliable, and on the
other to the prevalence of IDEs in Java development .

 **Conclusion**  
We can conclude that both Java and Python languages have their own benefits.
It really is up to you to opt a particular language for your project. Where
Python is simple and succinct, Java is quick and more portable. While Python
codes are dynamically-coded, Java is statically-coded. Python’s future is very
glaring from where we see and presume that its future is assertive. Python is
far from perfect but if we say that python is a future and emerging language
than we have to agree that Java is present, it’s APIs are widely used.
