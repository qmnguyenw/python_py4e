Display Hostname and IP address in Python



There are many ways to find hostname and IP address of a local machine. Here
is a simple method to find hostname and IP address using python code.  
Library used â€“ **socket** : This module provides access to the BSD socket
interface. It is available on all modern Unix systems, Windows, MacOS, and
probably additional platforms.  
 **  
Method used :**

  *  **gethostname()** : The gethostname function retrieves the standard host name for the local computer.
  *  **gethostbyname()** : The gethostbyname function retrieves host information corresponding to a host name from a host database.

def get_Host_name_IP():

 try:

 host_name = socket.gethostname()

 host_ip = socket.gethostbyname(host_name)

 print("Hostname : ",host_name)

 print("IP : ",host_ip)

 except:

 print("Unable to get Hostname and IP")
