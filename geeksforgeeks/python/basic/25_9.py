Python Language advantages and applications



Python is a high level, interpreted and general purpose dynamic programming
language that focuses on code readability.It has fewer steps when compared to
Java and C.It was founded in 1991 by developer Guido Van Rossum.It is used in
many organizations as it supports multiple programming paradigms.It also
performs automatic memory management.  
 **Advantages :**  
1) Presence of third-party modules  
2) Extensive support libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for
data analytics etc)  
3) Open source and community development  
4) Easy to learn  
5) User-friendly data structures  
6) High-level language  
7) Dynamically typed language(No need to mention data type based on value
assigned, it takes data type)  
8) Object-oriented language  
9) Portable and Interactive  
10) Portable across Operating systems

 **Applications :**  
1) GUI based desktop applications(Games, Scientific Applications)  
2) Web frameworks and applications  
3) Enterprise and Business applications  
4) Operating Systems  
5) Language Development  
6) Prototyping
