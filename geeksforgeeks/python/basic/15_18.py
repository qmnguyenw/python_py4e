Python | Converting all strings in list to integers



Interconversion between data types is facilitated by python libraries quite
easily. But the problem of converting the entire list of string to integers is
quite common in development domain. Letâ€™s discuss few ways to solve this
particular problem.  

 **Method #1 : Naive Method**

This is most generic method that strikes any programmer while performing this
kind of operation. Just looping over whole list and convert each of the string
of list to int by type casting.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# converting list of strings to int

# using naive method 

 

# initializing list 

test_list = ['1', '4', '3', '6', '7']

 

# Printing original list

print ("Original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# using naive method to

# perform conversion

for i in range(0, len(test_list)):

 test_list[i] = int(test_list[i])

 

 

# Printing modified list 

print ("Modified list is : " + str(test_list))  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output:**

    
    
    Original list is : ['1', '4', '3', '6', '7']
    Modified list is : [1, 4, 3, 6, 7]
    

  
**Method #2 : Using list comprehension**

  

  

This is just a kind of replica of the above method, just implemented using
list comprehension, kind of shorthand that a developer looks for always. It
saves time and complexity of coding a solution.

# using list comprehension to

# perform conversion

test_list = [int(i) for i in test_list]

 

 

# Printing modified list 

print ("Modified list is : " + str(test_list))  
  
---

 **Output:**

    
    
    Original list is : ['1', '4', '3', '6', '7']
    Modified list is : [1, 4, 3, 6, 7]
    

  
**Method #3 : Usingmap()**

This is the most elegant, pythonic and recommended method to perform this
particular task. This function is exclusively made for this kind of task and
should be used to perform them.
