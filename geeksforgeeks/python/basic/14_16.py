Perl vs Python



Perl is a general purpose, high level interpreted and dynamic programming
language. It was developed by Larry Wall, in 1987. Perl was originally
developed for the text processing like extracting the required information
from a specified text file and for converting the text file into a different
form. Perl supports both the procedural and Object-Oriented programming. Perl
is a lot similar to C syntactically and is easy for the users who have
knowledge of C, C++.

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It
was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python
Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability,
and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

 _Below are some major differences between Perl and Python:_ Feature| Perl|
Python|  **Introduction**|  Perl is a general purpose high level language
popular for CGI scripts. Some of the popular projects in Perl are CPanel and
Bugzilla. It was initially designed to replace complex shell scripts.| Python
is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. Due to its
rich library and support, it has wide applications in Web Development, Machine
Learning, Desktop Applications, etc.|  **Whitespaces**|  Perl does not care
about whitespaces.| Python deals with whitespaces and a syntax error generates
if whitespaces are not according to Python.|  **Focus**|  Perl accentuates
support for common tasks such as report generation and file scanning.| Python
accentuates support for common methodologies such as object-oriented
programming and data structure design.|  **File Extension**|  The .pl file
extension is used to save Perl Scripts. For example myDocument.pl| The .py
file extension is used to save Python Scripts. Example: myFile.py|  **End of
Statement**|  All statements should end with a semi colon in Perl.| It is not
necessary to end the statements with a semi colon in Python as it deals with
whitespaces.|  **Comments and Documentation**|  For Inline comments, we use #
in Perl.  
e.g. #Inline-Comment in Perl  
whereas for documentation we use  
= and =cut  
e.g. =Documentation in Perl  
starts from here and ends here. =cut| Python also uses # for Inline comments.  
e.g. #Inline-Comment in Python  
but for documentation we use  
“”” i.e. Three inverted commas  
e.g. “””Documentation in Python  
starts from here and ends here.”””|  **Statement Blocks**|  Perl uses braces
to mark the statement blocks.| Python use indentations to mark the statement
blocks.|  **Datatypes**|  Some data types contained by Perl are numeric,
string, Scalars, Arrays, Hashes.| Some data types contained by Python are
numeric, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples.
