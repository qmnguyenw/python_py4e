Dictionary Methods in Python | Set 1 (cmp(), len(), items()â€¦)



Python Dictionary Basics have been discussed in the article below

Dictionary

Some dictionary methods are discussed in this article.

 **1\. str(dic)** :- This method is used to **return the string** , denoting
all the dictionary keys with their values.

 **2\. items()** :- This method is used to **return the list** with all
dictionary keys with values.

# Python code to demonstrate working of

# str() and items()

 

# Initializing dictionary

dic = { 'Name' : 'Nandini', 'Age' : 19 }

 

# using str() to display dic as string

print ("The constituents of dictionary as string are : ")

print (str(dic))

 

# using str() to display dic as list

print ("The constituents of dictionary as list are : ")

print (dic.items())

Output:

    
    
    The constituents of dictionary as string are : 
    {'Name': 'Nandini', 'Age': 19}
    The constituents of dictionary as list are : 
    dict_items([('Name', 'Nandini'), ('Age', 19)])
    

**3\. len()** :- It returns the **count of key entities** of the dictionary
elements.

 **4\. type()** :- This function **returns the data type** of the argument.

li = [ 1, 3, 5, 6 ]

 

# using len() to display dic size

**5\. copy()** :- This function creates the **shallow copy of the dictionary**
into other dictionary.

 **6\. clear()** :- This function is used to **clear the dictionary**
contents.
