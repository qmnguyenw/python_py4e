join() function in Python



  
The join() method is a string method and returns a string in which the
elements of sequence have been joined by str separator.

 **Syntax:**

    
    
    _string_name_.join(iterable) 
    
    **string_name** : It is the name of string in which
                 joined elements of iterable will be
                 stored.
    

**Parameters:** The join() method takes iterable â€“ objects capable of
returning its members one at a time. Some examples are **List, Tuple, String,
Dictionary and Set**

 **Return Value:** The join() method returns a string concatenated with the
elements of _iterable_.

 **Type Error** : If the iterable contains any non-string values, it raises a
TypeError exception.
