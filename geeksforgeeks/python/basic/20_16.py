How to print without newline in Python?



Generally people switching from C/C++ to Python wonder how to print two or
more variables or statements without going into a new line in python. Since
the python print() function by default ends with newline. Python has a
predefined format if you use print(a_variable) then it will **go to next line
automatically.**  
For examples:

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

print("geeks")

print("geeksforgeeks")  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

will result into this

    
    
    geeks
    geeksforgeeks
    

But sometime it may happen that we donâ€™t want to go to next line but want to
print on the same line. So what we can do?  
 **For Example:**

    
    
    Input : print("geeks") print("geeksforgeeks")
    Output : geeks geeksforgeeks
    
    Input : a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    Output : 1 2 3 4 
    

The solution discussed here is totally dependent on the python version you are
using.
