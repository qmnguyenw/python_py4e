How to write an empty function in Python â€“ pass statement?



In C/C++ and Java, we can write empty function as following

    
    
    // An empty function in C/C++/Java
    void fun() {  }
    

In Python, if we write something like following in Python, it would produce
compiler error.

# Incorrect empty function in Python

def fun():   
  
---  
  
__

__

Output :

    
    
    IndentationError: expected an indented block

In Python, to write empty functions, we use **pass** statement. pass is a
special statement in Python that does nothing. It only works as a dummy
statement.

mutex = True

while (mutex == True) :

 pass

We can use pass in empty if else statements.

# Empty in if/else in Python
