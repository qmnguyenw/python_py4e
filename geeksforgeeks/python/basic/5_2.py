Python â€“ Coefficient of Determination-R2 score



Coefficient of determination also called as R2 score is used to evaluate the
performance of a linear regression model. It is the amount of the variation in
the output dependent attribute which is predictable from the input independent
variable(s). It is used to check how well-observed results are reproduced by
the model, depending on the ratio of total deviation of results described by
the model.

 ** **Mathematical Formula:****

    
    
     **R 2= 1- SSres / SStot**

Where,  
SSres is the sum of squares of the residual errors.  
SStot is the total sum of the errors.

 **Interpretation of R 2 score:**  
Assume R2 = 0.68  
It can be referred that 68% of the changeability of the dependent output
attribute can be explained by the model while the remaining 32 % of the
variability is still unaccounted for.  
R2 indicates the proportion of data points which lie within the line created
by the regression equation. A higher value of R2 is desirable as it indicates
better results.

 **Examples**  
 **Case 1 Model gives accurate results**

     **R 2 = 1- 0/200 = 1**

 **Case 2 Model gives same results always**

     **R 2 = 1- 200/200 = 0**

 **Case 3 Model gives ambiguous results**

     **R 2 = 1- 600/200 = -2**

We can import r2_score from sklearn.metrics in Python to compute R2 score.

 **Python Implementation:**  
 **Code 1: Import r2_score from sklearn.metrics**

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

from sklearn.metrics import r2_score  
  
---

 **Code 2: Calculate R 2 score for all the above cases.**

### Assume y is the actual value and f is the predicted values

y =[10, 20, 30]

f =[10, 20, 30]

r2 = r2_score(y, f)

print('r2 score for perfect model is', r2)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output:**

    
    
    r2 score for perfect model is 1.0

### Assume y is the actual value and f is the predicted values

y =[10, 20, 30]

f =[20, 20, 20]

r2 = r2_score(y, f)

print('r2 score for a model which predicts mean value always is', r2)

   
  
---  
  
__

__

**Output:**

    
    
    r2 score for a model which predicts mean value always is 0.0

 **Code 3:**

### Assume y is the actual value and f is the predicted values

y = [10, 20, 30]

f = [30, 10, 20]

r2 = r2_score(y, f)

print('r2 score for a worse model is', r2)  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output:**

    
    
    r2 score for a worse model is -2.0

 **Conclusion:**

  * The best possible score is 1
