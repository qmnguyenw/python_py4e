Python – The new generation Language



Python designed by Guido van Rossum at CWI has become a widely used general-
purpose, high-level programming language.

 **Prerequisites:**

Knowledge of any programming language can be a plus.

 **Reason for increasing popularity**

  1. Emphasis on **code readability, shorter codes** , ease of writing
  2. Programmers can express logical concepts in **fewer lines** of code in comparison to languages such as C++ or Java.
  3. Python supports **multiple** programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural.
  4. There exists inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.
  5. Philosophy is “Simplicity is the best”.

 **LANGUAGE FEATURES**

  

  

  *  **Interpreted**
    * There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++.
    * Directly _run_ the program from the source code.
    * Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes which is then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.
    * No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.
  *  **Platform Independent**
    * Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
    * Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.
  *  **Free and Open Source;** Redistributable
  *  **High-level Language**
    * In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.
  *  **Simple**
    * Closer to English language;Easy to Learn
    * More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax
  *  **Embeddable**
    * Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.
  *  **Robust** :
    * Exceptional handling features
    * Memory management techniques in built
  *  **Rich Library Support**
    * The Python Standard Library is vary vast.
    * Known as the **“batteries included”** philosophy of Python ;It can help do various things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, email, XML, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI and many more.
    * Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries such as the Python Imaging Library which is an amazingly simple image manipulation library.

 **Python vs JAVA** **Python**|  **Java**|  **Dynamically Typed** 1.No need to
declare anything. An assignment statement binds a name to an object, and the
object can be of any type. _2._ No type casting required when using container
objects|  **Statically Typed** 1.All variable names (along with their types)
must be explicitly declared. Attempting to assign an object of the wrong type
to a variable name triggers a type exception. _2._ Type casting is required
when using container objects.|  **Concise** **** Express much in limited
words|  **Verbose** Contains more words|  **Compact**|  **Less Compact**|
**Uses Indentation for structuring code**|  **Uses braces for structuring
code**

 **Java Code**

public class HelloWorld

{

 public static void main (String[] args)

 {

 System.out.println("Hello, world!");

 }

}

 **Similarity with Java**

  * Require some form of runtime on your system (JVM/Python runtime)
  * Can probably be compiled to executables without the runtime (this is situational, none of them are designed to work this way)

**Softwares making use of Python**

Python has been successfully embedded in a number of software products as a
scripting language.

  1. GNU Debugger uses Python as a **pretty printer** to show complex structures such as C++ containers.
  2. Python has also been used in artificial intelligence
  3. Python is often used for **natural language processing** tasks.

 **Current Applications of Python**

  1. A number of Linux distributions use installers written in Python example in Ubuntu we have the **Ubiquity**
  2. Python has seen extensive use in the **information security industry** , including in exploit development.
  3. Raspberry Pi– single board computer uses Python as its principal user-programming language.
  4. Python is now being used **Game Development** areas also.

 **Pros:**

  1. Ease of use
  2. Multi-paradigm Approach

 **Cons:**

  1. Slow speed of execution compared to C,C++
  2. Absence from mobile computing and browsers
  3. For the C,C++ programmers switching to python can be irritating as the language requires proper indentation of code. Certain variable names commonly used like sum are functions in python. So C, C++ programmers have to look out for these.

 **Industrial Importance**

Most of the companies are now looking for candidates who know about Python
Programming. Those having the knowledge of python may have more chances of
impressing the interviewing panel. So I would suggest that beginners should
start learning python and excel in it.

 **GeeksforGeeks is very soon going to introduce programming in Python too.**
