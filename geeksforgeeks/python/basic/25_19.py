Matrix manipulation in Python



In python matrix can be implemented as 2D list or 2D Array. Forming matrix
from latter, gives the additional functionalities for performing various
operations in matrix. These operations and array are defines in module ‚Äú
**numpy** ‚Äú.

 **Operation on Matrix :**

 **1\. add() :-** This function is used to perform **element wise matrix
addition**.

 **2\. subtract() :-** This function is used to perform **element wise matrix
subtraction**.

 **3\. divide() :-** This function is used to perform **element wise matrix
division**.

# using divide() to divide matrices

Output :

    
    
    The element wise addition of matrix is : 
    [[ 8 10]
     [13 15]]
    The element wise subtraction of matrix is : 
    [[-6 -6]
     [-5 -5]]
    The element wise division of matrix is : 
    [[ 0.14285714  0.25      ]
     [ 0.44444444  0.5       ]]
    

**4\. multiply() :-** This function is used to perform **element wise matrix
multiplication**.

 **5\. dot() :-** This function is used to compute the **matrix
multiplication, rather than element wise multiplication**.

**6\. sqrt() :-** This function is used to compute the **square root of each
element** of matrix.

 **7\. sum(x,axis) :-** This function is used to **add all the elements in
matrix**. Optional ‚Äúaxis‚Äù argument computes the **column sum if axis is 0**
and **row sum if **axis** is 1**.

 **8\. ‚ÄúT‚Äù :-** This argument is used to **transpose** the specified matrix.
