7 Cool Python Project Ideas for Intermediate Developers



Python in the world of programming everyone is familiar with the popularity of
this language. Learning python and building the project is always an amazing
experience for developers. This language really deserves hype in today’s era
and why not if it can solve a lot of real-world problems. Well, every
programmer’s journey starts with learning the basics of any programming
language and once they move ahead they realize the importance of building the
projects using the same language. They become curious to know how things work
in some applications and they try to get some practical exposure to expand
their knowledge by building some cool projects. If you’re a developer then
learning the syntax of a language is not enough….it’s important to know that
how the concepts of a language can be applied to solve some real-world
problems or challenges. Well, python is not an exception.

**Python** is a very powerful language and the best thing is it’s easy to
learn. You can build a lot of cool stuff using this language. So don’t just
get stuck on theoretical concepts. Once you know the basics of this language,
go ahead, explore, find out some good projects to work on, and get some
practical exposure. In programming always remember that getting hands-on
experience is the best way to strengthen your knowledge. Today in this blog we
are going to discuss some projects you can work on as an intermediate Python
developer. These projects are not too hard and not too easy. There will be
some challenges while building these projects and you will really enjoy
solving those problems. We have divided the projects into three categories…

  1.  **Web Applications:** Basically developers are responsible for building both the front-end and back-end part of the application. As a python developer, your main focus would be back-end part where all the business logic gets implemented. You can use some Python web frameworks such as Django and Flask.
  2.  **Desktop GUI:** You can make your own Desktop Graphical User Interface application using Python. **PySimpleGUI** is one of the user friendly framework for Desktop applications. **PyQt5** is another advanced powerful GUI framework but it has steep learning curve.
  3.  **Command-Line:** Command line applications work in a console window. You can use **docopt** , **argparse** , and **click** frameworks to build your applications.

Now let’s discuss some projects for all the above three categories one by one…

## Web Projects

### 1\. URL Shortener Tool

 **Project Details:** Are you familiar with some tools like bit.ly and TinyURL
? These tools shorten the URL and makes them easy to remember. Long URLs are
filled with difficult characters and it’s not easy to remember them. These
services reduces the characters or letters in URLs and returns a new shorten
URL to the user. For example:
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore/?category%5B%5D=Arrays&page;=1 can
be converted into https://tinyurl.com/y92ysnmb. So here the goal is to build
similar kind of application.

  

  

**Technical Details:** The main goal of this app is to shorten the URL and
when the user visits the shorten URL, he/she must be redirected to the
original URL. To generate the characters for shortened URL you can use the
combination of the **random** and **string** modules. You need to save the
original and shortened URLs in the database so whenever a user visits the
shortened URL (days, months, or even years after) the application checks the
database, if the URL exists, it redirects to the original, or else it
redirects to a 404 page.

 **Additional Challenge:** You can make this tool more user friendly by adding
the feature of custom URL option for user. It will be easier for a user to
remember the custom URL generated by themselves.

**Real Life Examples:**

  * Bit.ly
  * TinyURL

### 2\. Pin Your Note

 **Project Details:** We get so many ideas throughout the day and it’s a
common nature of human that we forget the things very easily (even the
important ideas or thoughts) due to our busy schedule or for some other
reason. To remember things easily isn’t it a good idea to make an app that
create a note of our ideas online? Using Python you can build a Pin Your Note
application where a user can list out all the things he/she wants to remember
and that list will be accessible from anywhere (since it is on a digital
platform).

**Technical Details:** The main aim of this project is to allow users to save
their ideas. Each user will have their own private notes and to create private
notes you need to create an account creation feature with authentication. You
can use Django framework which comes with its authentication system but if
you’re using bottle or flask you will have to implement the user
authentication on your own.

You can also add the feature that allows users to make a category of the
notes. This way users will be able to segment their notes under different
categories. For example, a user can create one section for programming
languages, one for data structure and algorithms and the other one for
databases.

If we talk about using the database for this application to store the
information then you can use **MySQLdb** module if you select MySQL database
or the **psycopg2** module for a PostgreSQL database. You can also use other
modules but that depends on the database you select for the application.

**Additional Challenge:** A lot of times we forget that we have created our
important notes somewhere and that time we expect that somebody can remind us
about the notes. So you can add a reminder feature in this app. This feature
will allow the users to set a time for the reminder and he/she will receive a
notification by email about the notes.

  

  

 **Real Life Examples:**

  * Pinup
  * Note.ly

### 3\. Quiz Application

 **Project Details:** Quizzes are always helpful in testing the knowledge,
identifying the mistakes and correcting those mistakes. Taking an online test
is the best way to understand the concepts completely. Using Python you can
create a Quiz application that will list out a series of questions for users
and the users will be allowed to answer those questions. Think of the Quiz
Application as a kind of questionnaire.

**Technical Details:** The main goal is to set quizzes (series of questions)
and people have to answer those questions. The app will display the final
score and the right answer to the questions. Here you need to think about the
admin users because only the admin will be allowed to create the quiz or set
the questions for other users (who will attend the quiz).

You need to implement the account creation feature to keep the individual
records of scores. Admin user should be able to create tests with the
questions and answers by simply uploading a text file. You can choose any
format for the text file but the application should convert this file to a
quiz. In your database, you need to store the questions, possible answers,
correct answers, and the scores for each user. You can use **MySQLdb** module
if you select MySQL database or the **psycopg2** module for a PostgreSQL
database. You can also use other modules but that depends on the database you
select for the application.

**Additional Challenge:** Add a feature that allow users to add timers to the
quizzes. This way the creators of a quiz (admin users) can determine how many
seconds or minutes a user should spend on each question in the quiz. You can
also add the quiz-sharing feature where a user can share interesting quizzes
on other platforms.

 **Real Life Examples:**

  * Kahoot
  * myQuiz

## GUI Projects

### 1\. MP3 Player

 **Project Details:** It is not possible to play the contents of an audio file
without a player. Audio files are digital files and you can showcase your
skill by building a tool MP3 player using Python. You need to build an MP3
player software that emulate the physical MP3 player. Using this software,
users will be allowed to play an MP3 files on the desktop, laptop or computer.

**Technical Details:** The goal is to build an MP3 software that allows it’s
users to play MP3 and other digital audio files. You need to focus on building
a beautiful user interface for the better engagement of the users. The
interface will be listing the available MP3 files. A user can also have the
option to list other digital audio files that are not MP3. Also, a user should
be able to see the information on the file that is playing. You can include
some information such as as….

  * The name of the file
  * Its length
  * The amount played (minutes and seconds)
  * The amount not played (minutes and seconds)

To handle the MP3 files and other digital audio files you can use **pygame** ,
**pymedia** and **simpleaudio** library in Python. These libraries allow you
to work with multimedia files in a few lines of code. You can also add a
feature that allows users to create a playlist. To store the information of
created playlist you can use **sqlite3** module of SQLite database.

 **Additional Challenge:** Add a feature that allows users to repeat currently
playing files or even shuffle the list of files to be played. You can also
include one feature that allows the users to increase and decrease the playing
speed of the audio file.

 **Real Life Examples:**

  * MusicBee
  * Foobar2000 

### **2\. Alarm Clock**

 **Project Details:** We use the alarm in our day to day life that gives an
audio or visual reminder about a certain condition. Using Python you need to
build an alarm software that allows users to set time for a certain condition
and when the condition is met it should give an audio signal. This tool will
work from the user’s laptop or desktop device.

 **Technical Details:** In this project you need to mainly focus on the timing
and the audio signal of the alarm because the main objective is to activate
audio signals at certain times of the day. Add the feature that allows users
to create, edit, and delete alarms. Also, the interface should display all the
active and inactive alarms. For audio signals or reminder, you need to set the
tone in your software. You can use **pygame** library playing audio. You also
need to save information on alarms in your database such as…alarm date, time,
and tone location.

 **Additional Challenge:** Add a feature that allows users to set recurring
alarms. Using this feature user will be able to set alarms that will ring at a
certain time on certain days of the week, every week. For example, an alarm
can be set at 11:00 AM every Saturday. You can also add the snooze feature in
this application.

**Real Life Examples:**

  * FreeAlarmClock 
  * TimerForMac 

## Command-LIne Projects

### 1\. Site Connectivity Checker

 **Project Details:** When we visit a URL or a website, most of the time we
get the information whatever we need on our browser. Sometimes websites can be
down and it can give some error message in the browser. This might happen due
to some server issue. Here you can showcase your skill and build a site
connectivity checker. A site connectivity checker gives the status of a
website, visiting the URL. It visits the URL at regular intervals and returns
the results of each visit. Instead of visiting the URLs manually to check the
site status, you can use this tool to monitor multiple websites from one page.

 **Technical Details:** The main goal is to check the status of a website. To
implement this feature you can use TCP or ICMP for your connection. Socket
programming in python will help you to make the connection. Use socket module
in Python and to learn more about socket programming visit the link Python
Socket or Python network programming . User should be able to add and remove
sites from the list of sites to be checked. You can use **docopt** , **click**
, or **argparse** frameworks to add commands for these features. Keep in mind
that user should be capable to start the tool, stop it and determine the
intervals. You also need to save the list of the files checked and to do this
you can use **sqlite3** module of SQLite database.

**Additional Challenge:** User needs to keep checking the command line to
check the status of the site. To avoid this you can add notification feature
(Ex: a sound played in the background) to alert the user when a site’s status
changes. Maintain the previous status of a site in your database because
that’s the only way the tool can tell when the status changes.

 **Real Life Examples:**

  * Uptrends
  * Site24X7

###  **2\. File Renaming Tool**

 **Project Details:** A lot of time we need to rename the files in our
directory according to certain conventions. **** For example, File001.jpg,
File002.jpg, File003.jpg, and this goes on. Doing this task manually can be
repetitive and boring. To avoid this manual work, you can create a tool to
rename a large number of files.

**Technical Details:** The main goal is to **** create a tool to rename files
without mistakes in a couple of seconds. To rename the target files, you can
use **os** , **sys** , and **shutil** libraries available in Python. Users
should be able to pass the naming convention of their own choice to rename all
the files in the directory. Here the **regex** module will help match the
required naming patterns if you know how regex works. If a user pass naming
convention such as myfiles as part of the commands then the tool should rename
the files like myfiles123, where 123 is a number.

**Additional Challenge:** Implement a feature that allow users to **** choose
only certain number of files for renaming, instead of all the files. For this
feature the tool will sort the files based on alphabetical order, time of file
creation, or file size, depending on the user’s requirements.

 **Real Life Examples:**

  * Rename
  * Ren Command
