Python Keywords – Introduction  
Keywords in Python | Set 1

**More keywords:**  
 **16\. try** : This keyword is used for exception handling **,** used to
catch the errors in the code using the keyword except. Code in “try” block is
checked, if there is any type of error, except block is executed.

 **17\. except** : As explained above, this works together with “try” to catch
exceptions.

 **18\. raise** : Also used for exception handling to explicitly raise
exceptions.

 **19\. finally** : No matter what is result of the “try” block, block termed
“finally” is always executed. Detailed article –Exception Handling in Python

  

  

 **20\. for** : This keyword is used to control flow and for looping.

 **21\. while** : Has a similar working like “for” , used to control flow and
for looping.

 **22\. pass** : It is the null statement in python. Nothing happens when this
is encountered. This is used to prevent indentation errors and used as a
placeholder  
Detailed Article – for, while, pass

 **23\. import** : This statement is used to include a particular module into
current program.

 **24\. from** : Generally used with import, from is used to import particular
functionality from the module imported.

 **25\. as** : This keyword is used to create the alias for the module
imported. i.e giving a new name to the imported module. E.g import math as
mymath.  
Detailed Article – import, from and as

 **26\. lambda** : This keyword is used to make inline returning functions
with no statements allowed internally. Detailed Article – map, filter, lambda

 **27\. return** : This keyword is used to return from the function. Detailed
article – Return values in Python.

  

  

 **28\. yield** : This keyword is used like return statement but is used to
return a generator. Detailed Article – yield keyword

 **29\. with** : This keyword is used to wrap the execution of block of code
within methods defined by context manager.This keyword is not used much in day
to day programming.

 **30\. in** : This keyword is used to check if a container contains a value.
This keyword is also used to loop through the container.

 **31\. is** : This keyword is used to test object identity, i.e to check if
both the objects take same memory location or not.

# Python code to demonstrate working of

# using "in" to check

if 's' in 'geeksforgeeks':

 print ("s is part of geeksforgeeks")

else : print ("s is not part of geeksforgeeks")

# using "in" to loop through

for i in 'geeksforgeeks':

 print (i,end=" ")

print ("\r")

 

# using is to check object identity

# string is immutable( cannot be changed once allocated)

# hence occupy same memory location

print (' ' is ' ')

# using is to check object identity

# dictionary is mutable( can be changed once allocated)

# hence occupy different memory location

print ({} is {})

 **Output:**

    
    
    s is part of geeksforgeeks
    g e e k s f o r g e e k s 
    True
    False

 **32\. global** : This keyword is used to define a variable inside the
function to be of a global scope.

 **33\. non-local** : This keyword works similar to the global, but rather
than global, this keyword declares a variable to point to variable of outside
enclosing function, in case of nested functions.

    Value of a using nonlocal is : 10
    Value of a without using nonlocal is : 5
