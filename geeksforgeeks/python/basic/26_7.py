Enumerate() in Python



A lot of times when dealing with iterators, we also get a need to keep a count
of iterations. Python eases the programmersâ€™ task by providing a built-in
function enumerate() for this task.  
Enumerate() method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of
enumerate object. This enumerate object can then be used directly in for loops
or be converted into a list of tuples using list() method.  
 **Syntax:**

    
    
    enumerate(iterable, start=0)
    
    **Parameters:**
    **Iterable:** any object that supports iteration
    **Start:** the index value from which the counter is 
                  to be started, by default it is 0

obj2 = enumerate(s1)

print ("Return type:",type(obj1))

print (list(enumerate(l1)))

# changing start index to 2 from 0

print (list(enumerate(s1,2)))

 **Output:**  

    
    
    Return type: < type 'enumerate' >
    [(0, 'eat'), (1, 'sleep'), (2, 'repeat')]
    [(2, 'g'), (3, 'e'), (4, 'e'), (5, 'k')]
