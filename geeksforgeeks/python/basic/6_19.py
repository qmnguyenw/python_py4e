Python â€“ Convert Snake case to Pascal case



Sometimes, while working with Python Strings, we have problem in which we need
to perform a case conversion of String. This a very common problem. This can
have application in many domains such as web development. Lets discuss certain
ways in which this task can be performed.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Convert Snake case to Pascal case

# Using title() + replace()

 

# initializing string

test_str = 'geeksforgeeks_is_best'

 

# printing original string

print("The original string is : " + test_str)

 

# Convert Snake case to Pascal case

# Using title() + replace()

res = test_str.replace("_", " ").title().replace(" ", "")

 

# printing result 

print("The String after changing case : " + str(res))
