Python program to count upper and lower case characters without using inbuilt
functions



Given a string that contains both upper and lower case characters in it. The
task is to count number of upper and lower case characters in it without using
in-built functions.

Counting the upper and lower case characters of a string can be easily done
using isupper() and islower() functions, refer this. But doing the same
without help of any inbuilt function is quite exciting. Letâ€™s see how this can
be done :

Examples :

    
    
    Input : Introduction to Python
    Output : Lower Case characters : 18 Upper case characters : 2
    
    Input :  Welcome to GeeksforGeeks
    Output : Lower Case characters : 19  Upper case characters: 3
    

  
Below is the implementation of above idea :

# Python3 program to count upper and

# lower case characters without using

# inbuilt functions

def upperlower(string):

 

 upper = 0

 lower = 0

 

 for i in range(len(string)):

 

 # For lower letters

 if (ord(string[i]) >= 97 and

 ord(string[i]) <= 122):

 lower += 1

 

 # For upper letters

 elif (ord(string[i]) >= 65 and

 ord(string[i]) <= 90):

 upper += 1

 

 print('Lower case characters = %s' %lower,

 'Upper case characters = %s' %upper)

 

# Driver Code

string = 'GeeksforGeeks is a portal for Geeks'

upperlower(string)  
  
---

 **Output:**

  

  

    
    
    Lower case characters = 27 Upper case characters = 3
