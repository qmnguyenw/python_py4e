Difference between Python and C++



 **Python tutorial:** Python is a high-level, interpreted programming
language. It was invented back in 1991, by Guido Van Rossum. Python is an
object-oriented programming language that has large enormous library support
making the implementation of various programs and algorithms easy. Its
language constructs and object-oriented approach aims to help programmers to
write clear, logical code for various projects.

 **C++ tutorial: **C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language
created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or
“C with Classes”. The language has expanded significantly over time, and
modern C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition
to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

 **Python vs C++** Parameter| Python| C++| Code| Python has less lines of
code.| C++ tends to have large lines of code.| Garbage Collection| Python
supports garbage collection| C++ doesn’t support garbage collection.| Syntax|
Python is easy to remember almost similar to human language.| C++ has a stiff
learning curve as it has lots of predefined syntaxes and structure|
Compilation| Python uses interpreter.| C++ is pre; compiled.| Speed| Python is
slower since it uses interpreter and also determines the data type at run
time.| C++ is faster in speed as compared to python.| Rapid Prototyping| Rapid
Prototyping is possible due to the small size of the code.| Rapid Prototyping
not possible due to larger code size.| Efficiency| Easier to maintain, object-
oriented and simpler to use| Less clean and manageable in comparison to
python| Nature| Python is dynamically typed.| C++ is statically typed.

 **Conclusion**  
Python leads to one conclusion: Python is better for beginners in terms of its
easy-to-read code and simple syntax. Additionally, Python is a good option for
web development (backend), while C++ is not very popular in web development of
any kind.  
Python is also a leading language for data analysis and machine learning.
While it is possible to use C++ for machine learning purposes as well, it is
not a good option. In terms of simplicity, Python is much easier to use and
has a great support system when it comes to AI and ML frameworks.
