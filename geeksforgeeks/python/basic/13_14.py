Python IDEs For Data Science



Data Science is a field that is used to study and understand data and draw
various conclusions with the help of different scientific processes. Python is
a popular language that is quite useful for data science because of its
capacity for statistical analysis and its easy readability. Python also has
various packages for machine learning, natural language processing, data
visualization, data analysis, etc. that make it suited for data science. Some
of the Python IDE’s that are used for Data Science are given as follows:

  1.  **Jupyter notebook –**  
Jupyter notebook is an open source IDE that is used to create Jupyter
documents that can be created and shared with live codes. Also, it is a web-
based interactive computational environment. The Jupyter notebook can support
various languages that are popular in data science such as Python, Julia,
Scala, R, etc.
