numpy.full_like() in Python



The **numpy.full_like()** function return a new array with the same shape and
type as a given array.

 **Syntax :**

    
    
    numpy.full_like(a, fill_value, dtype = None, order = 'K', subok = True)

 **Parameters :**

    
    
    **shape :** Number of rows
    **order :** C_contiguous or F_contiguous
    **dtype :** [optional, float(by Default )] Data type of returned array.  
    **subok :** [bool, optional] to make subclass of a or not
