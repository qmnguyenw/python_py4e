How Much Python Should You know To Learn Django?



 _ **How much python is required to learn Django??**_

This question comes to the mind of every beginner and experienced developer
who wants to learn Django and build an application in it. No doubt most of the
developers or beginner wants to learn any framework or library as soon as
possible. We all want to know the minimum prerequisite that is needed to learn
any framework or library. Here we are going to talk about the most popular
framework Django…

Different Django experienced developers have different opinions on this topic
and everyone has a different approach to learn Django.

Now coming to the main topic….how much Python is required to learn Django?

Jumping to Django directly may backfire on you if you aren’t confident in
Python. A lot of times it happens that while building an application in Django
we struggle with the issues in it, but it is not the framework that creates
the problem, it is Python that is responsible for the issues.

  

  

But the question is…do we need to learn everything in Python to start
Django…and the short answer is no…….

Instead of learning everything in Python and then starting with Django, learn
only sufficient Python so that you can start with Django and then while
learning Django you can learn Python, both in parallel. Start building an
application and see what kind of real-world problems you run into and then
learn that on the way. Half of the coding will be done on trial and error,
doing the research also. If you follow this approach then you won’t have to
spend a lot of time learning Django and Python.

If you’re a beginner then surely you need to learn a lot of basic concepts in
Python and if you’re an experienced developer then you just need to understand
the syntax for the basic concepts in Python. Let’s summarize the concepts of
Python that are needed to work on Django. Also, we will discuss why these
concepts are important to learn.

### 1\. Download Python and Learn pip and Functions

Firstly you need to download python and get that up and running. Understand
how to run a simple pip install and install Django. Once you are done with it
start with learning the basics…

### 2\. Basics Concepts

If you’re a beginner in programming then you need to first understand the
basics of Python. Variables, data types, conditional statements, for-loops all
these things come into the basics of python. Understanding these concepts is
important in order to proceed not just in python but also in programming.
These concepts are part of all the programming languages. You will be
struggling a lot in Django if the basics are not clear to you.

### **3\. Iterables**

Once you have gone through the basic concepts, you need to learn iterables. In
python list and tuples are described as iterables. Their objects allow you to
iterate through it using for loops or while loops. These objects are essential
ways that we can actually loop through the massive amount of data.

In Django most of the time, you will be working with Querysets. Query sets are
also objects, and you can consider them as storage like a list, but they also
have some other properties that allow you to perform some complex operations
such as filtering, mutations, comparisons, etc. So Query sets are a little
complex than lists, but they behave in the same way because they are
iterables.

We can loop through the Querysets in the exact same way we can loop through
lists and tuples. So if you’re not familiar with lists, tuples, and iterating
through an object then surely you will struggle with Query sets in Django. So
make sure that you have a good understanding of iterables and how to iterate
over an object.

  

  

### 4\. Dictionaries

In Python, dictionaries store the data in key-value pairs. For example, you
can create an object and that object can have the first name, last name, and
age. We can store all the values in the dictionary. In Django, you will be
working with dictionaries while adding the **context** to a template.

You can access the information of context inside an HTML template. Context is
the concept of working with templates in Django. This is the reason you should
understand it first as a python object. Also, understand the methods in
dictionaries such as **.update, .pop.**

### **5\. Functions**

Functions are the important concepts in all programming languages. While
working with Django you will be writing functions a lot. It is good to have
knowledge about functions and how it works before you dive into Django. Also
while working with Django understand the concept of  ***args** and
****kwargs.**

###  **6\. Decorators**

Learning decorators are quite optional. It is not used often in an
application. Decorators give you extra functionality. You will see this in
Django when login required decorators. You can also use the already existing
decorators. Using decorators is quite easy in an application. Understand what
happens inside the decorators. How to write your own decorator and how they
work.

### 7\. Classes

Classes are a crucial part of Django. Understand the concept of classes before
you start working on Django. In Django most of the code, you will be writing
using classes. You need to focus on the things given below to learn everything
about classes.

In Django, you will be using classes in **Models** , **Forms** , and
**Views**. You can also use functions, but classes make things simpler in your
application. Below are some details to learn everything about classes.

  * Syntax of writing a class.
  * Object-oriented paradigm.
  * Understand the concept of the ‘self’ keyword
  * Special methods such as __init__method.
  * Difference between an instance and a class.
  * Inheritance
  * Methods (instance methods, class methods)
  * Concept of super () function.
  * Concept of overriding

### 8\. Packages

Another important concept to learn in Python is packages. While working with
Django you will be importing a lot of functions and classes from Django
modules. You will be struggling a lot in your Django application if you don’t
know how to import and work with libraries and third-party packages.

You can start with the python libraries such as ‘ **pandas**‘ and ‘
**numpy**‘. Understand how to import and work with the Python packages.

### Conclusion

It’s not easy to learn Django if you don’t have a strong foundational
knowledge of Python. You don’t need to learn everything in Python but at least
make your fundamental concepts clear in Python to start with the Django
application. Focus especially on classes and object-oriented programming in
Python. It will be easier for you to dive into Django if the fundamentals are
clear to you.
