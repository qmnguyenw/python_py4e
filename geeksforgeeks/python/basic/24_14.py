Python Operators



Operators in general are used to perform operations on values and variables in
Python. These are standard symbols used for the purpose of logical and
arithmetic operations. In this article, we will look into different types of
Python operators.

  1.  **Arithmetic operators:** Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.Operator| Description| Syntax| +| Addition: adds two operands| x + y| -| Subtraction: subtracts two operands| x - y| *| Multiplication: multiplies two operands| x * y| /| Division (float): divides the first operand by the second| x / y| //| Division (floor): divides the first operand by the second| x // y| %| Modulus: returns the remainder when first operand is divided by the second| x % y| **| Power : Returns first raised to power second| x ** y

# Examples of Arithmetic Operator

a = 9

b = 4

 

# Addition of numbers 

add = a + b 

 

# Subtraction of numbers 

sub = a - b 

 

# Multiplication of number 

mul = a * b 

 

# Division(float) of number 

div1 = a / b 

 

# Division(floor) of number 

div2 = a // b 

 

# Modulo of both number 

mod = a % b 

 

# Power

p = a ** b

 

# print results 

print(add) 

print(sub) 

print(mul) 

print(div1) 

print(div2) 

print(mod)

print(p)
