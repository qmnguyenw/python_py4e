Python | Difference Between List and Tuple



List and Tuple in Python are the class of data structure. The list is dynamic,
whereas the tuple has static characteristics.  
**List** is just like the arrays, declared in other languages. Lists need not
be homogeneous always which makes it the most powerful tool in Python. In
Python, the list is a type of container in Data Structures, which is used to
store multiple data at the same time. Lists are a useful tool for preserving a
sequence of data and further iterating over it.  
**Syntax:**

    
    
    list_data = ['an', 'example', 'of', 'a', 'list']

Tuple is also a sequence data type that can contain elements of different data
types, but these are immutable in nature. In other words, a tuple is a
collection of Python objects separated by commas. The tuple is faster than the
list because of static in nature.  
**Syntax:**

    
    
    tuple_data = ('this', 'is', 'an', 'example', 'of', 'tuple')

 **Difference Between List and Tuple in Python:** SR.NO.| LIST| TUPLE| 1|
Lists are mutable| Tuples are immutable| 2| Implication of iterations is Time-
consuming| The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster| 3| The list
is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.| Tuple
data type is appropriate for accessing the elements| 4| Lists consume more
memory| Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list| 5| Lists have
several built-in methods| Tuple does not have many built-in methods.| 6| The
unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur| In tuple, it is hard
to take place.
