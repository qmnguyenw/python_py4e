Python | Build a REST API using Flask



Prerequisite: Introduction to Rest API

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and is an architectural style
used in modern web development. It defines a set or rules/constraints for a
web application to send and receive data.

In this article, we will build a REST API in Python using the Flask framework.
Flask is a popular micro framework for building web applications. Since it is
a micro-framework, it is very easy to use and lacks most of the advanced
functionality which is found in a full-fledged framework. Therefore, building
a REST API in Flask is very simple.

There are two ways of creating a REST API in Flask:

  1. Using Flask without any external libraries
  2. Using flask_restful library

## Libraries required:

flask_restful can be installed via the pip command:

  

  

    
    
     sudo pip3 install flask-restful 

## Method 1: using only Flask

Here, there are two functions: One function to just return or print the data
sent through GET or POST and another function to calculate the square of a
number sent through GET request and print it.

# Using flask to make an api

# import necessary libraries and functions

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

 

# creating a Flask app

app = Flask(__name__)

 

# on the terminal type: curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/

# returns hello world when we use GET.

# returns the data that we send when we use POST.

@app.route('/', methods = ['GET', 'POST'])

def home():

 if(request.method == 'GET'):

 

 data = "hello world"

 return jsonify({'data': data})

 

 

# A simple function to calculate the square of a number

# the number to be squared is sent in the URL when we use GET

# on the terminal type: curl http://127.0.0.1:5000 / home / 10

# this returns 100 (square of 10)

@app.route('/home/<int:num>', methods = ['GET'])

def disp(num):

 

 return jsonify({'data': num**2})

 

 

# driver function

if __name__ == '__main__':

 

 app.run(debug = True)

## Method 2: Using flask-restful

Flask Restful is an extension for Flask that adds support for building REST
APIs in Python using Flask as the back-end. It encourages best practices and
is very easy to set up. Flask restful is very easy to pick up if youâ€™re
already familiar with flask.

In flask_restful, the main building block is a resource. Each resource can
have several methods associated with it such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
for example, there could be a resource that calculates the square of a number
whenever a get request is sent to it. Each resource is a class that inherits
from the Resource class of flask_restful. Once the resource is created and
defined, we can add our custom resource to the api and specify a URL path for
that corresponding resource.

# using flask_restful

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

from flask_restful import Resource, Api

 

# creating the flask app

app = Flask(__name__)

# creating an API object

api = Api(app)

 

# making a class for a particular resource

# the get, post methods correspond to get and post requests

# they are automatically mapped by flask_restful.

# other methods include put, delete, etc.

class Hello(Resource):

 

 # corresponds to the GET request.

 # this function is called whenever there

 # is a GET request for this resource

 def get(self):

 

 return jsonify({'message': 'hello world'})

 

 # Corresponds to POST request

 def post(self):

 

 data = request.get_json() # status code

 return jsonify({'data': data}), 201

 

 

# another resource to calculate the square of a number

class Square(Resource):

 

 def get(self, num):

 

 return jsonify({'square': num**2})

 

 

# adding the defined resources along with their corresponding urls

api.add_resource(Hello, '/')

api.add_resource(square, '/square/<int:num>')

 

 

# driver function
