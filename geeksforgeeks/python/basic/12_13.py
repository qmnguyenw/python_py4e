How to approach a Machine Learning project : A step-wise guidance



This article will provide a basic procedure on how should a beginner approach
a Machine Learning project and describe the fundamental steps involved. In the
problem, we will focus on the classification of iris flowers. You can learn
about the dataset here.

Many teachers and websites take up this problem to demonstrate the various
nuances involved in a Machine Learning project because â€“

* All the attributes are **numeric** and all the attributes are of same scale and units.
* The problem in hand is a **classification problem** and thus gives us an option to explore many evaluation metrics.
* The dataset involved is a **small and clean** and thus can be handled easily.
