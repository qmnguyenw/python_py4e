Singleton Method – Python Design Patterns



 **Prerequisite:** **Singleton Design pattern | Inroduction**

Singleton Method is a type of Creational Design pattern and is one of the
simplest design pattern available to us. It is a way to provide one and only
one object of a particular type. It involves only one class to create methods
and specify the objects.  
Singleton Design Pattern can be understood by a very simple example of
Database connectivity. When each object creates a unique Database Connection
to the Database, it will highly affect the cost and expenses of the project.
So, it is always better to make a single connection rather than making extra
irrelevant connections which can be easily done by **Singleton Design
Pattern**.

>  **Definition:** The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts
> the instantiation of a class to one object.

Now let’s have a look at the different implementations of the Singleton Design
pattern.

  

  

### Method1 : Monostate/Borg Singleton Design pattern

Singleton behavior can be implemented by Borg’s pattern but instead of having
only one instance of the class there are multiple instances that share the
same state. Here we don’t focus on the sharing of the instance identity
instead we focus on the sharing state.

# Singleton Borg pattern

class Borg:

 

 # state shared by each instance

 __shared_state = dict()

 

 # constructor method

 def __init__(self):

 

 self.__dict__ = self.__shared_state

 self.state = 'GeeksforGeeks'

 

 def __str__(self):

 

 return self.state

 

# main method

if __name__ == "__main__":

 

 person1 = Borg() # object of class Borg

 person2 = Borg() # object of class Borg

 person3 = Borg() # object of class Borg

 

 person1.state = 'DataStructures' # person1 changed the state

 person2.state = 'Algorithms' # person2 changed the state

 

 print(person1) # output --> Algorithms

 print(person2) # output --> Algorithms

 

 person3.state = 'Geeks' # person3 changed the

 # the shared state

 

 print(person1) # output --> Geeks

 print(person2) # output --> Geeks

 print(person3) # output --> Geeks

### Double Checked Locking Singleton Design pattern

It is easy to notice that once an object is created, the synchronization of
the threading is no longer useful because now object will never be equal to
None and any sequence of operations will lead to consistent results.  
So, when the object will be equal to None, then only we will acquire the
**Lock** on the getInstance method.

import threading

 

class SingletonDoubleChecked(object):

 

 # resources shared by each and every

 # instance

 

 __singleton_lock = threading.Lock()

 __singleton_instance = None

 

 # define the classmethod

 @classmethod

 def instance(cls):

 

 # check for the singleton instance

 if not cls.__singleton_instance:

 with cls.__singleton_lock:

 if not cls.__singleton_instance:

 cls.__singleton_instance = cls()

 

 # return the singleton instance

 return cls.__singleton_instance

 

# main method

if __name__ == '__main__':

 

 # create class X

 class X(SingletonDoubleChecked):

 pass

 

 # create class Y

 class Y(SingletonDoubleChecked):

 pass

 

 A1, A2 = X.instance(), X.instance()

 B1, B2 = Y.instance(), Y.instance()

 

 assert A1 is not B1

 assert A1 is A2

 assert B1 is B2

 

 print('A1 : ', A1)

 print('A2 : ', A2)

 print('B1 : ', B1)

 print('B2 : ', B2)

 **Output:**

    
    
    A1 :  __main__.X object at 0x02EA2590
    A2 :  __main__.X object at 0x02EA2590
    B1 :  __main__.Y object at 0x02EA25B0
    B2 :  __main__.Y object at 0x02EA25B0
    

### Classic implementation of Singleton Design Pattern

In the classic implementation of the Singleton Design pattern, we simply use
the static method for creating the getInstance method which has the ability to
return the shared resource. We also make use of so-called **Virtual private
Constructor** to raise the exception against it although which is not much
required.

 __shared_instance = 'GeeksforGeeks'

 

 @staticmethod

 def getInstance():

 

 """Static Access Method"""

 if Singleton.__shared_instance == 'GeeksforGeeks':

 Singleton()

 return Singleton.__shared_instance

 

 def __init__(self):

 

 """virtual private constructor"""

 if Singleton.__shared_instance != 'GeeksforGeeks':

 raise Exception ("This class is a singleton class !")

 else:

 Singleton.__shared_instance = self

 

# main method

if __name__ == "__main__":

 

 # create object of Singleton Class

 obj = Singleton()

 print(obj)

 

 # pick the instance of the class

 obj = Singleton.getInstance()

 print(obj)

### Advantages of using Singleton Method:

  1.  **Initializations:** Object created by Singleton method is initialized only when it is requested for the first time.
  2.  **Access to the object:** We got the global access to the instance of the object.
  3.  **Count of instances:** In singleton method classes can’t have more than one instance

### Disadvantages of using Singleton Method:

  1.  **Multithread Environment:** Its not easy to use the singleton method in multithread environment, because we have to take care that multithread wouldn’t create singleton object several times.
  2.  **Single responsibility Principle:** As the Singleton method is solving two problems at a single time, it doesn’t follow the single responsibility principle.
  3.  **Unit testing process:** As they introduce the global state to the application, it makes the unit testing very hard.

### Applicability

  1.  **Controlling over global variables:** In the projects where we specifically need the strong control over the global variables, it is highy recommended to use **Singleton Method**
  2.  **Daily Developers use:** Singleton patterns are generally used in providing the logging, caching, thread pools and configuration settings and oftenly used in conjuction with Factory design pattern.
