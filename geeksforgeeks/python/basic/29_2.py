Interesting facts about strings in Python -Set 1

Like other programming languages, itâ€™s possible to access individual
characters of a string by using array-like indexing syntax. In this we can
access each and every element of string through their index number and the
indexing starts from 0. Python does index out of bound checking.

So, we can obtain the required character using syntax,
**string_name[index_position]** :

  * The positive index_position denotes the element from the starting(0) and the negative index shows the index from the end(-1).

 **Example:**

# A python program to illustrate slicing in strings

 

x = "Geeks at work"

 

# Prints 3rd character beginning from 0 

print (x[2]) 

 

# Prints 7th character 

print (x[6]) 

 

# Prints 3rd character from the rear beginning from -1 

print (x[-3]) 

 

# Length of string is 10 so it is out of bound 

print (x[15])

**Slicing**

To extract substring from the whole string then we use the syntax like

    
    
     **string_name[beginning: end : step]**

  * beginning represents the starting index of string
  * end denotes the end index of string which is not inclusive 
  * steps denotes the distance between the two words.

Note: We can also slice the string using beginning and only and _**steps are
optional.**_
