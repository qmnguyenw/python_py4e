Python | Set 6 (Command Line and Variable Arguments)



Previous Python Articles (Set 1 | Set 2 | Set 3 | Set 4 | Set 5)  
This article is focused on command line arguments as well as variable
arguments (args and kwargs) for the functions in python.

## Command Line Arguments

Till now, we have taken input in python using raw_input() or input() [for
integers]. There is another method that uses command line arguments. The
command line arguments must be given whenever we want to give the input before
the start of the script, while on the other hand, raw_input() is used to get
the input while the python program / script is running.

For example, in the UNIX environment, the arguments ‘-a’ and ‘-l’ for the ‘ls’
command give different results.

The command line arguments in python can be processed by using either ‘sys’
module or ‘argparse’ module.

# Python code to demonstrate the use of 'sys' module

# for command line arguments

 

import sys

 

# command line arguments are stored in the form

# of list in sys.argv

argumentList = sys.argv

print argumentList

 

# Print the name of file

print sys.argv[0]

 

# Print the first argument after the name of file

print sys.argv[1]  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

OUTPUT :

  

  

    
    
    ['program1.py', 'test', '1']
    program1.py
    test
    

**NOTE :** The above code runs only on command line. We need to fire the below
command given that the program is saved as program1.py  
python program1.py test 123  
  
Please note the following points about the above program :

  * The sys.argv takes the command line arguments in the form of a list.
  * The first element in the list is the name of the file.
  * The arguments always come in the form of a string even if we type an integer in the argument list. We need to use int() function to convert the string to integer.

  
We can use the command line arguments to write the programs which do
frequently used tasks. For example, we need to find factorial many times. We
can keep the following program in a file named factorial.py in our computer
and get the output by simply writing the command for getting the factorial of
a number, say 5.  
python factorial.py 5

import sys

from math import factorial

 

print factorial(int(sys.argv[1]))

## Variable Arguments

### args(*) and kwargs(**)

Both ‘args’ and ‘kwargs’ are used to get arbitrary number of arguments in a
function.

 **args will give us all the function parameters in the form of a list and
kwargs will give us all the keyword arguments except for those corresponding
to formal parameter as dictionary.**

# Python program to illustrate the use of args which

# multiplies all the values given to the function as parameter

 

def multiplyAll(*values):

 mul = 1

 

 # values(args) will be in the form of tuple

 print values

 print "Type = ", type(values)

 

 

 # Multiplying the all the parameters and return the result

 for i in values:

 mul = mul * i

 

 return mul

 

 

# Driver program to test above function

 

# Multiply two numbers using above function

ans = multiplyAll(1,2)

print "The multiplication of 1 and 2 is ", ans

 

# Multiply 5 numbers using above function

ans = multiplyAll(3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

print "The multiplication of 3 to 7 is ", ans

OUTPUT :

    
    
    (1, 2)
    Type =  
    The multiplication of 1 and 2 is  2
    (3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
    Type =  
    The multiplication of 3 to 7 is  2520
    

Note that **args** are denoted by using a single star and **kwargs** are
denoted by two stars before the formal parameters in the function.

# Program to illustrate the use of kwargs in Python

 

# Function that print the details of a student

# The number of details per student may vary

def printDetails(**details):

 

 # Variable 'details' contains the details in the

 # form of dictionary

 print "Parameter details contains"

 print details 

 print "Type = ", type(details)

 

 # Print first name 

 print "First Name = ", details['firstName']

 

 # Print the department of student

 print "Department = ", details['department']

 print "" # Extra line break

 

 

# Driver program to test above function

 

# Calling the function with three arguments

printDetails(firstName = "Nikhil", 

 rollNumber = "007",

 department = "CSE")

 

# Calling the function with two arguments

printDetails(firstName = "Abhay",

 department = "ECE")  
  
---

Output:

    
    
    Parameter details contains
    {'department': 'CSE', 'rollNumber': '007', 'firstName': 'Nikhil'}
    Type =  
    First Name =  Nikhil
    Department =  CSE
    
    Parameter details contains
    {'department': 'ECE', 'firstName': 'Abhay'}
    Type =  
    First Name =  Abhay
    Department =  ECE
    

  
Please **note** that if you are using both args and kwargs in a function then
the args parameter must precede before the kwarg parameters.  
Example :

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# Function containing both args and kwargs

def cheeseshop(kind, *arguments, **keywords):

 print "-- Do you have any", kind, "?"

 print "-- I'm sorry, we're all out of", kind

 for arg in arguments:

 print arg

 print "-" * 40

 keys = sorted(keywords.keys())

 for kw in keys:

 print kw, ":", keywords[kw]

 

# Driver program to test above function

cheeseshop("Burger", "It's very funny, sir.",

 "It's really very, VERY funny, sir.",

 shopkeeper='Michael Palin',

 client="John Cleese",

 sketch="Cheese Shop Sketch")
