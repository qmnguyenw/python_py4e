Python | Maximum and Minimum in a Set



In this article, we will learn how to get the maximum and minimum element in a
set in Python, using the built-in functions of Python.  
Examples:

    
    
    Input : set = ([8, 16, 24, 1, 25, 3, 10, 65, 55])
    Output : max is 65
    
    Input : set = ([4, 12, 10, 9, 4, 13])
    Output : min is 4

on to the solution.

 **max() in a Set**

The built-in function max() in Python is used to get the maximum of all the
elements in a set.
