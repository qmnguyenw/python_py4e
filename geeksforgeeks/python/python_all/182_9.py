Python Program for Recursive Insertion Sort



Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort
playing cards in our hands.  
Below is an iterative algorithm for insertion sort

 **Algorithm**

    
    
    // Sort an arr[] of size n
    insertionSort(arr, n) 
        Loop from i = 1 to n-1.
           a) Pick element arr[i] and insert
              it into sorted sequence arr[0..i-1]

# Driver program to test insertion sort
