Download Anything to Google Drive using Google colab



When we download/upload something from a cloud server, it gives more transfer
rate as compared to a normal server. We can use **Google Drive** for storage
as well as fast speed download. The problem is how to upload something to
G-Drive direct from Internet. So, Here we will see a solution to upload
anything to Google drive directly from Internet.

All we need is google account and a few lines of code.

 **Google Colab** :

Google Colab is a free cloud service with GPU support. It is like Jupyter
Notebook and very simple to use. In this tutorial, we will be using Google
Colab to download anything to our google drive.

 **Step #1 :** Sign in to Google Colab and Create a new Python3 notebook.

**Step #2 : Importing google drive to colab**

  

  

To import google drive, write this code in code section of colab and run it by
_Ctrl+Enter_.

from google.colab import drive

drive.mount('/content/gdrive')

On running code, one blue link and a text box will appear we need to provide a
permission text. So click the link and a new tab will open where you will be
asked for permission to access google drive. After providing permissions a
text will be displayed that we need to Copy and paste on colabs text box.

Paste text in box and press enter. That all to import gdrive. We can see
google drive on Left side Panel.

**Step #3 : Download something to Google Drive**

To download something all we need is URL to downloadable file.

 __

 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

import requests 

file_url = "http://1.droppdf.com/files/5iHzx/automate-the-boring-stuff-
with-python-2015-.pdf"

 

r = requests.get(file_url, stream = True) 

 

with open("/content/gdrive/My Drive/python.pdf", "wb") as
file: 

 for block in r.iter_content(chunk_size = 1024):

 if block: 

 file.write(block)   
  
---  
  
__

__

Run this code to download the files in gdrive (Change the _file_url_ with your
**fileâ€™s url** ).

We can see on the left side panel that pdf file is downloaded.

 **Conclusion :**  
We can use google colab to download any file on google drive. As you can see a
folder _parrot_ (parrot OS of 3.7 GB ), downloaded to gdrive using Colab.
