Python | Interval Initialization in list



There are numerous ways to initialize the list with the elements, but
sometimes, its required to initialize the lists with the numbers in a sliced
way. This can be custom and hence knowledge of this can come handy. Letâ€™s
discuss certain ways in which this can be done.  

 **Method #1 : Usinglist comprehension + enumerate()**  
The list comprehension can do the possible iteration part and enumerate can
help in the part of logic and checking for the valid elements required in the
list.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# interval initializing in list 

# using list comprehension + enumerate()

 

# initializing lists

test_list = list(range(50))

 

# printing original list

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# interval elements

N = 5

 

# interval difference

K = 15

 

# using list comprehension + enumerate()

# interval initializing in list 

res = [i for j, i in enumerate(test_list) if j % K < N
]

 

# printing result 

print ("The modified initialized list : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

> The original list is : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
> 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,
> 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]  
> The modified initialized list : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 30, 31,
> 32, 33, 34, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]

  

  

**Method #2 : Usingitertools.compress() + itertools.cycle()**  
The above two function can combine to facilitate the solution of the discussed
problem. The cycle function can to the task of repetition and the compress
function can be beneficial when it comes to clubbing the segments together.

# using itertools.compress() + itertools.cycle()

func = cycle([True] * N + [False] * (K - N))

res = list(compress(test_list, func))

 

# printing result 

print ("The modified initialized list : " + str(res))
