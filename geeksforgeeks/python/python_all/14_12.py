Python â€“ Test if elements of list are in Min/Max range from other list



Given two lists, the task is to write a Python Program to return true if all
elements from second list are in range of min and max values of the first
list.

 **Examples:**

>  **Input** : test_list = [5, 6, 3, 7, 8, 10, 9], range_list = [4, 7, 9, 6]  
> **Output** : True  
> **Explanation** : Min and max in list 1 are 3 and 10, all elements are in
> range in other list.  
>
>
> **Input** : test_list = [5, 6, 3, 7, 8, 10, 9], range_list = [4, 7, 9, 16]  
> **Output** : False  
> **Explanation** : Min and max in list 1 are 3 and 10, all elements are not
> in range in other list.

**Method #1 : Using loop +** **min()** **+** **max()**

  

  

In this, we iterate for all the elements in second list and compare for each
element, if any element is less than min or greater than max, result is
flagged off and false is returned.

# Using loop + min() + max()

 

# initializing list

test_list = [5, 6, 3, 7, 8, 10, 9]

 

# printing original lists

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing range_list

range_list = [4, 7, 9, 6]

 

res = True

for ele in range_list:

 

 # flag off list in case of any off range element

 if ele max(test_list):

 res = False

 break

 

# printing result

print("Are all elements in min/max range? : " + str(res))

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list is : [5, 6, 3, 7, 8, 10, 9]
    Are all elements in min/max range? : True

 **Method #2 : Using** **all()** **+** **min()** **+** **max()**

In this, we check for all the elements to be in range using all(), and min()
and max() are used to get the maximum and minimum elements.
