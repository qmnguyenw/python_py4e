Python Program to find Sum of Negative, Positive Even and Positive Odd numbers
in a List



Given a list. The task is to find the sum of Negative, Positive Even, and
Positive Odd numbers present in the List.

 **Examples:**

    
    
     **Input:** -7 5 60 -34 1 
    **Output:**
    Sum of negative numbers is  -41 
    Sum of even positive numbers is  60 
    Sum of odd positive numbers is  6
    
    **Input:** 1 -1 50 -2 0 -3
    **Output:**
    Sum of negative numbers is  -6
    Sum of even positive numbers is  50
    Sum of odd positive numbers is  1

Negative numbers are the numbers less than 0 while positive even numbers are
numbers greater than 0 and also divisible by 2. 0 is assumed to be a positive
even number, in this case.

**Approach:**

  * The first approach input a list of numbers from the user.
  * Two loops are run, one for the positive numbers and the other for the negative numbers, computing the numbersâ€™ summation.
  * If n is the size of the list of numbers,
  * it takes O(2n) time complexity, for iterating over the list of numbers twice.

# input a list of numbers

list_num = [-7, 5, 60, -34, 1]

 

# creating an object of class

# calling method for sum

# of all negative numbers

obj.negSum(list_num)

# sum of all positive numbers

 **Output:**

  

  

    
    
    Sum of negative numbers is  -41
    Sum of even positive numbers is  60
    Sum of odd positive numbers is  6
    

The second approach computes the sum of respective numbers in a single loop.
It maintains three counters for each of the three conditions, checks the
condition and accordingly adds the value of the number in the current sum .
**If n is the size of the list of numbers, it takes O(n) time complexity, for
iterating over the list of numbers once.**
