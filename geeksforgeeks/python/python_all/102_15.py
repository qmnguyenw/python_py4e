Python | Append K character N times



Sometimes, we wish to manipulate a string in such a way in which we might need
to add additional K at the end of string in case of filling the missing bits
or any other specific requirement. The solution to this kind of problems is
always handy and is good if one has knowledge of it. Letâ€™s discuss certain
ways in which this can be solved.

 **Method #1 : Usingljust()**  
This task can be performed using the simple inbuilt string function of ljust
in which we just need to pass N times required and the element to right pad,
in this case being K.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Append K character N times

# using ljust()

 

# initializing string 

test_string = 'GFG'

 

# printing original string 

print("The original string : " + str(test_string))

 

# initializing K 

K = 'M'

 

# No. of K required

N = 5

 

# using ljust()

# Append K character N times

res = test_string.ljust(N + len(test_string), K)

 

# print result

print("The string after adding trailing K : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original string : GFG
    The string after adding trailing K : GFGMMMMM
    

**Method #2 : Usingformat()**  
String formatting using the format function can be used to perform this task
easily, we just mention the number of elements total, element needed to pad,
and direction of padding, in this case right.

temp = '{:<' + K + str(len(test_string) + N) + '}'

res = temp.format(test_string)

 

# print result

print("The string after adding trailing K : " + str(res))

    The string after adding trailing K : GFG00000
