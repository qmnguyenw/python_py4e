Python Program for Common Divisors of Two Numbers



Given two integer numbers, the task is to find count of all common divisors of
given numbers?

    
    
    Input : a = 12, b = 24
    Output: 6
    // all common divisors are 1, 2, 3, 
    // 4, 6 and 12
    
    Input : a = 3, b = 17
    Output: 1
    // all common divisors are 1
    
    Input : a = 20, b = 36
    Output: 3
    // all common divisors are 1, 2, 4
