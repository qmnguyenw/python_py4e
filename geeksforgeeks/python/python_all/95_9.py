Python â€“ String uncommon characters



One of the string operation can be computing the uncommon characters of two
strings i.e, output the uncommon values that appears in both the strings. This
article deals with computing the same through different ways.

 **Method 1 : Usingset() + symmetric_difference()**  
Set in python usually can perform the task of performing set operations such
as set symmetric difference. This utility of sets can be used to perform this
task as well. Firstly, both the strings are converted into sets using set()
and then symmetric difference is performed using symmetric_difference().
Returns the sorted set.

# Python 3 code to demonstrate

# String uncommon characters

# using set() + symmetric_difference()

 

# initializing strings

test_str1 = 'GeeksforGeeks'

test_str2 = 'Codefreaks'

 

# Printing initial strings

print ("The original string 1 is : " + test_str1)

print ("The original string 2 is : " + test_str2)

 

# String uncommon characters

# using set() + symmetric_difference()

res = set(test_str1).symmetric_difference(test_str2)

 

# printing symmetric_difference

print ("The string uncommon elements are : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original string 1 is : GeeksforGeeks
    The original string 2 is : Codefreaks
    The string uncommon elements are : {'C', 'd', 'a', 'G'}
    

**Method 2 : Usingjoin()**  
join() performs the task similar to list comprehension in case of lists. This
encapsulates whole symmetric_difference logic and joins together each element
filtered through the symmetric_difference logic into one string, hence
computing the symmetric_difference. It converts the strings into set and then
computed ^ operation on them.
