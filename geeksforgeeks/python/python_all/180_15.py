Python Program for Program to calculate area of a Tetrahedron



A Tetrahedron is simply a pyramid with a triangular base. It is a solid object
with four triangular faces, three on the sides or lateral faces, one on the
bottom or the base and four vertices or corners. If the faces are all
congruent equilateral triangles, then the tetrahedron is called regular.

The volume of the tetrahedron can be found by using the following formula :

> Volume = a3/(6&Sqrt;2)

Examples :

    
    
    Input : side = 3
    Output : 3.18
    
    
    Input : side = 20
    Output : 942.81
