Python â€“ Sort List items on basis of their Digits



Given List of elements, perform sorting on basis of digits of numbers.

>  **Input** : test_list = [434, 211, 12, 3]  
>  **Output** : [12, 211, 3, 434]  
>  **Explanation** : 3 < 12, still later in list, as initial digit, 1 < 3\.
> Hence sorted by digits rather than number.
>
>  **Input** : test_list = [534, 211, 12, 7]  
>  **Output** : [12, 211, 534, 7]  
>  **Explanation** : 7 < 534, still later in list, as initial digit, 5 < 7\.
> Hence sorted by digits rather than number.

 **Method #1 : Using map() + str() + ljust() + sorted()**

In this, the list elements are converted into string using map() and str(),
ljust() is used to append constant character to make each number equal length.
Then sort is performed using sorted().

test_list = [434, 211, 12, 54, 3]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# converting elements to string 

temp1 = map(str, test_list)

 

# getting max length

max_len = max(map(len, temp1))

 

# performing sort operation

res = sorted(test_list, key = lambda idx :
(str(idx).ljust(max_len, 'a')))

 

# printing result 

print("List after sorting : " + str(res))

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list is : [434, 211, 12, 54, 3]
    List after sorting : [12, 211, 3, 434, 54]
    
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension + sorted() + lambda**

In this, we as parameter to sorted(), pass a list of digits. Performing sort
according to that gives desired results.
