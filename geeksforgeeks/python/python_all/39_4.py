Python â€“ Split List on next larger value



Given a List, perform split on next larger value.

>  **Input** : test_list = [4, 2, 3, 7, 5, 1, 3, 4, 11, 2]  
>  **Output** : [[4, 2, 3], [7, 5, 1, 3, 4], [11, 2]]  
>  **Explanation** : After 4, 7 is greater, split happens at that element, and
> so on.

>  **Input** : test_list = [4, 2, 3, 7, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2]  
>  **Output** : [[4, 2, 3], [7, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2]]  
>  **Explanation** : After 4, 7 is greater, split happens at that element.

 **Method : Using loop**

In this, we iterate list and keep track of split value, if higher value than
recorded value is found, new list is created from it, and split value is
current value.

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list is : [4, 2, 3, 7, 5, 9, 3, 4, 11, 2]
    Split List : [[4, 2, 3], [7, 5], [9, 3, 4], [11, 2]]
