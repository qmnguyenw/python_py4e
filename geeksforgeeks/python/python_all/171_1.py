Python | Combining two sorted lists



Many a times we encounter a problem where we wish to use the merge function of
merge sort and is a classical problem that occurs many times while doing
competitive programming. This type of problem when known shorter and compact
way to perform them are always quite handy.

Letâ€™s discuss certain ways of combining two sorted list in Python.  

 **Method #1 : Naive Method**

Merge operation of merge sort can be performed using the naive method which
has also been discussed earlier. We check for the smaller of two element on
the current index and increment the index of the list whose no. is
encountered. When either of the list gets exhausted, the other list is
appended to the end of merged list.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# to combine two sorted list 

# using naive method 

 

# initializing lists

test_list1 = [1, 5, 6, 9, 11]

test_list2 = [3, 4, 7, 8, 10]

 

# printing original lists 

print ("The original list 1 is : " + str(test_list1))

print ("The original list 2 is : " + str(test_list2))

 

# using naive method 

# to combine two sorted lists

size_1 = len(test_list1)

size_2 = len(test_list2)

 

res = []

i, j = 0, 0

 

while i < size_1 and j < size_2:

 if test_list1[i] < test_list2[j]:

 res.append(test_list1[i])

 i += 1

 

 else:

 res.append(test_list2[j])

 j += 1

 

res = res + test_list1[i:] + test_list2[j:]

 

# printing result

print ("The combined sorted list is : " + str(res))

 **Output:**

  

  

    
    
    The original list 1 is : [1, 5, 6, 9, 11]
    The original list 2 is : [3, 4, 7, 8, 10]
    The combined sorted list is : [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
