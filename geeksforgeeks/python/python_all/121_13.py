Python | Check if two list of tuples are identical



Sometimes, while working with tuples, we can have a problem in which we have
list of tuples and we need to test if they are exactly identical. This is a
very basic problem and can occur in any domain. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in
which this task can be done.

 **Method #1 : Using == operator**  
This is the simplest and elegant way to perform this task. It also checks for
equality of tuple indices with one other.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Check if two list of tuples are identical

# using == operator

 

# initialize list of tuples 

test_list1 = [(10, 4), (2, 5)]

test_list2 = [(10, 4), (2, 5)]

 

# printing original tuples lists

print("The original list 1 : " + str(test_list1))

print("The original list 2 : " + str(test_list2))

 

# Check if two list of tuples are identical

# using == operator

res = test_list1 == test_list2

 

# printing result

print("Are tuple lists identical ? : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list 1 : [(10, 4), (2, 5)]
    The original list 2 : [(10, 4), (2, 5)]
    Are tuple lists identical ? : True
    

**Method #2 : Usingcmp()**  
This inbuilt function, computes the difference of values of tuples. If they
are computed out to be 0, then it means that tuples are identical. Works only
with Python2.
