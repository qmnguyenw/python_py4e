Data Science Methodology and Approach



The people who work in Data Science and are busy finding the answers for
different questions every day comes across the Data Science Methodology. Data
Science Methodology indicates the routine for finding solutions to a specific
problem. This is a cyclic process that undergoes a critic behaviour guiding
business analysts and data scientists to act accordingly.

  1.  **Business Understanding:**  
Before solving any problem in the Business domain it needs to be understood
properly. Business understanding forms a concrete base, which further leads to
easy resolution of queries. We should have the clarity of what is the exact
problem we are going to solve.

  2.  **Analytic Understanding:**  
Based on the above business understanding one should decide the analytical
approach to follow. The approaches can be of 4 types: Descriptive approach
(current status and information provided), Diagnostic approach(a.k.a
statistical analysis, what is happening and why it is happening), Predictive
approach(it forecasts on the trends or future events probability) and
Prescriptive approach( how the problem should be solved actually).

  3.  **Data Requirements:**  
The above chosen analytical method indicates the necessary data content,
formats and sources to be gathered. During the process of data requirements,
one should find the answers for questions like ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘when’, ‘why’,
‘how’ & ‘who’.

  4.  **Data Collection:**  
Data collected can be obtained in any random format. So, according to the
approach chosen and the output to be obtained, the data collected should be
validated. Thus, if required one can gather more data or discard the
irrelevant data.

  5.  **Data Understanding:**  
Data understanding answers the question “Is the data collected representative
of the problem to be solved?”. Descriptive statistics calculates the measures
applied over data to access the content and quality of matter. This step may
lead to reverting the back to the previous step for correction.

  6.  **Data Preparation:**  
Let’s understand this by connecting this concept with two analogies. One is to
wash freshly picked vegetables and second is only taking the wanted items to
eat in the plate during the buffet. Washing of vegetables indicates the
removal of dirt i.e. unwanted materials from the data. Here noise removal is
done. Taking only eatable items in the plate is, if we don’t need specific
data then we should not consider it for further process. This whole process
includes transformation, normalization etc.

  7.  **Modelling:**  
Modelling decides whether the data prepared for processing is appropriate or
requires more finishing and seasoning. This phase focusses on the building of
predictive/descriptive models.

  8.  **Evaluation:**  
Model evaluation is done during model development. It checks for the quality
of the model to be assessed and also if it meets the business requirements. It
undergoes diagnostic measure phase (the model works as intended and where are
modifications required) and statistical significance testing phase (ensures
about proper data handling and interpretation).

  9.  **Deployment:**  
As the model is effectively evaluated it is made ready for deployment in the
business market. Deployment phase checks how much the model can withstand in
the external environment and perform superiorly as compared to others.

  10.  **Feedback:**  
Feedback is the necessary purpose which helps in refining the model and
accessing its performance and impact. Steps involved in feedback define the
review process, track the record, measure effectiveness and review with
refining.

After successful abatement of these 10 steps, the model should not be left
untreated, rather based on the feedbacks and deployment appropriate update
should be made. As new technologies emerge, new trends should be reviewed so
that the model continually provides value to solutions.
