Python Program to find tuple indices from other tuple list



Given Tuples list and search list consisting of tuples to search, our task is
to write a Python Program to extract indices of matching tuples.

>
>  **Output :** [3, 1]

 **Method #1 : Using** **lookup dictionary** **+** **enumerate()** **+**
**list comprehension**

In this, a lookup dictionary is formed to map all the tuples with matching
oneâ€™s indices. Then lookup dictionary is used to get indices of mapped tuples
as result using list comprehension.

# Using lookup dictionary + enumerate() + list comprehension

 

# initializing list

test_list = [(4, 5), (7, 6), (1, 0), (3,
4)]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing search tuple 

search_tup = [(3, 4), (8, 9), (7, 6), (1,
2)]

 

# creating lookup_dict

lookup_dict = {val: key for key,val in enumerate(test_list)}

 

# creating result list

res = [lookup_dict[idx] for idx in search_tup if idx in
lookup_dict]

 

# printing result

print("The match tuple indices : " + str(res))

 **Output:**

    
    
    The original list is : [(4, 5), (7, 6), (1, 0), (3, 4)]
    The match tuple indices : [3, 1]

 **Method #2 : Using list comprehension + enumerate()**

In this, we perform the task of getting indices using enumerate(), and list
comprehension is used for the task of iteration of all the elements of tuple
and matching for equality.
