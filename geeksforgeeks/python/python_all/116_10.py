Python | Case Counter in String



Sometimes, while working with Python String, we can have a problem in which we
need to separate the lower and upper case count. This kind of operation can
have its application in many domains. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this
task can be done.

 **Method #1 : Usingmap() + sum() + isupper() + islower()**  
The combination of the above functions can be used to perform this task. In
this, we separately extract the count using sum() and map() and respective
inbuilt functions.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Case Counter in String

# using map() + sum() + isupper + islower

 

# initializing string 

test_str = "GFG is For GeeKs"

 

# printing original string 

print("The original string is : " + test_str)

 

# Case Counter in String

# using map() + sum() + isupper + islower

res_upper = sum(map(str.isupper, test_str))

res_lower = sum(map(str.islower, test_str))

 

# printing result

print("The count of Upper case characters : " + str(res_upper))

print("The count of Lower case characters : " + str(res_lower))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original string is : GFG is For GeeKs
    The count of Upper case characters : 6
    The count of Lower case characters : 7
    

**Method #2 : Using Counter() +isupper() + islower()**  
The combinations of above methods can also be used to perform this particular
task. In this, we perform the task of holding count using Counter().

ele.islower()

# printing result

print("The count of Upper case characters : " +
str(res['upper']))

print("The count of Lower case characters : " +
str(res['lower']))

    The count of Lower case characters : 7
