Python | Multiply Adjacent elements



Sometimes, while working with data, we can have a problem in which we need to
find cumulative result. This can be of any type, product or summation. Here we
are gonna discuss about adjacent element multiplication. Letâ€™s discuss certain
ways in which this task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Usingzip() \+ generator expression + tuple()**  
The combination of above functionalities can be used to perform this task. In
this, we use generator expression to provide multiplication logic and
simultaneous element pairing is done by zip(). The result is converted to
tuple form using tuple().

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Adjacent element multiplication

# using zip() + generator expression + tuple

 

# initialize tuple

test_tup = (1, 5, 7, 8, 10)

 

# printing original tuple

print("The original tuple : " + str(test_tup))

 

# Adjacent element multiplication

# using zip() + generator expression + tuple

res = tuple(i * j for i, j in zip(test_tup,
test_tup[1:]))

 

# printing result

print("Resultant tuple after multiplication : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original tuple : (1, 5, 7, 8, 10)
    Resultant tuple after multiplication : (5, 35, 56, 80)
    

**Method #2 : Usingtuple() + map() \+ lambda**  
The combination of above functions can also help to perform this task. In
this, we perform multiplication and binding logic using lambda function. The
map() is used to iterate to each element and at end result is converted by
tuple().
