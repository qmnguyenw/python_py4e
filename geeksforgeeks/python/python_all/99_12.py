Python | Matrix Tuple pair Column product



Sometimes, we encounter a problem where we deal with a complex type of matrix
column product in which we are given a tuple and we need to perform the
product of its like elements. This has a good application in Machine Learning
domain. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this can be done.

 **Method #1 : Usingzip() \+ list comprehension**  
This problem can be resolved using the list comprehension which could perform
the column product logic and zip function is used to bind the elements as a
result and also at the time of vertical product.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Matrix Tuple pair Column product

# using list comprehension + zip()

 

# getting Product 

def prod(val) : 

 res = 1

 for ele in val: 

 res *= ele 

 return res 

 

# initializing list 

test_list = [[(1, 4), (2, 3), (5, 2)], [(3,
7), (1, 9), (10, 5)]]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension + zip()

# Matrix Tuple pair Column product

res = [tuple(prod(j) for j in zip(*i)) for i in
zip(*test_list)]

 

# print result

print("The product of columns of tuple list : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [[(1, 4), (2, 3), (5, 2)], [(3, 7), (1, 9), (10, 5)]]
    The product of columns of tuple list : [(3, 28), (2, 27), (50, 10)]
    

**Method #2 : Usingzip() + map()**  
The task of binding the column elements can also be performed using the map
function and the zip function performs the task of binding the product tuples.
Both logics bound by list comprehension.
