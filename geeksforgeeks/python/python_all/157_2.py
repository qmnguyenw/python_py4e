Python | First Non-Empty String in list



Sometimes while dealing with data science, we need to handle a large amount of
data and hence we may require shorthands to perform certain tasks. We handle
the Null values at preprocessing stage and hence sometimes require to check
for the 1st valid element. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which we can find the
first Non-Empty String.

 **Method #1 : Usingnext() \+ list comprehension**  
The next function returns the iterator and hence its more efficient that
conventional list comprehension and the logic part is handled using list
comprehension which checks for the last None value.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# First Non-Empty String in list

# using next() + list comprehension

 

# initializing list

test_list = ["", "", "Akshat", "Nikhil"]

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using next() + list comprehension

# First Non-Empty String in list

res = next(sub for sub in test_list if sub)

 

# printing result

print("The first non empty string is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : ['', '', 'Akshat', 'Nikhil']
    The first non empty string is : Akshat
    

**Method #2 : Usingfilter()**  
The filter function can be used to find the Non empty strings and the 0th
index is returned to get the first string among those. Works only with Python
2.
