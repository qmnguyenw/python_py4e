Python Program to get K length groups with given summation



Given a list, our task is to write a Python program to extract all K length
sublists with lead to given summation.

> **Input :** test_list = [6, 3, 12, 7, 4, 11], N = 21, K = 4

 **Method : Using** **sum()** **\+ product() +** **loop** ****

In this all possible sublists of length K are computed using product(), sum()
is used to compare the sublistâ€™s sum with the required summation.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# K length groups with given summation

# Using sum + product()

N = 21

 

# initializing size 

K = 4

 

# Looping for each product and comparing with required summation

for sub in product(test_list, repeat = K):

 if sum(sub) == N:

 res.append(sub)

 

# printing result
