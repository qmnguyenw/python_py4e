Python â€“ Specific Range Addition in List



Sometimes, while working with Python, we need to perform edition in Python
list. And sometimes we need to perform this to specific index range in it.
This kind of application can have application in many domains. Lets discuss
certain ways in which this task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using loop**  
This is brute way in which this task can be performed. In this, we just
iterate through the specified range in which the edition has to be performed.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Specific Range Addition in List

# using loop

 

# Initializing list

test_list = [4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11]

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# Initializing range 

i, j = 2, 5

 

# Specific Range Addition in List

# using loop

for idx in range(i, j):

 test_list[idx] += 3

 

# printing result 

print ("List after range addition : " + str(test_list))  
  
---

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11]
    List after range addition : [4, 5, 9, 11, 13, 11]
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension**  
This task can also be performed using list comprehension. This method uses
same way as above but its a shorthand to above.
