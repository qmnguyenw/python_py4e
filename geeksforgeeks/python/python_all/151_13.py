Python | Grouped Flattening of list



The problem of flattening a list is quite common, but sometimes, we need to
perform the flattening but in the grouped manner, i.e getting the sublists of
size K and flatten them. This particular utility has use-cases in many domains
including web-development and day-day programming as well. Letâ€™s discuss
certain ways in which this can be done.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension + list slicing**  
This problem can be approached by using the list comprehension and also
applying list slicing to limit the grouping and binding the list is done as a
part of list comprehension logic.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# group flattening of list 

# using list comprehension + list slicing

 

# initializing list of lists

test_list = [[1, 3], [3, 4], [6, 5], [4,
5], [7, 6], [7, 9]]

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# declaring K 

K = 3

 

# using list comprehension + list slicing

# group flattening of list 

res = [[i for sub in test_list[j : j + K] for i in
sub]

 for j in range(0, len(test_list), K)]

 

# printing result 

print("The grouped flattened list : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [[1, 3], [3, 4], [6, 5], [4, 5], [7, 6], [7, 9]]
    The grouped flattened list :  [[1, 3, 3, 4, 6, 5], [4, 5, 7, 6, 7, 9]]
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension +zip() + map()**  
This problem can also be solved using the combination of the above 3
functions. The zip function is used to get all the groups into one and map
function is used to convert the iterator into list and list comprehension
performs the task of grouping.

 for i in sub])]*(K * len(test_list[0])))))
