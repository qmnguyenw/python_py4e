Python | Equal Keys List Summation



Sometimes, while working with dictionaries, we can have a problem in which we
have many dictionaries and we are required to sum like keys. This problem
seems common, but complex is if the values of keys are list and we need to add
elements to list of like keys. Letâ€™s discuss way in which this problem can be
solved.

 **Method : Using list comprehension +items() + sum()**  
This problem can be solved using list comprehension and sum() that can be used
to sum the list content and also the items method which can be employed to get
the dictionary keys and values.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Equal Keys List Summation

# Using items() + list comprehension + sum()

 

# initializing dictionaries

test_dict1 = {'Gfg' : [1, 2, 3], 'for' : [2,
4], 'CS' : [7, 8]}

test_dict2 = {'Gfg' : [10, 11], 'for' : [5], 'CS'
: [0, 18]}

 

# printing original dictionaries

print("The original dictionary 1 is : " + str(test_dict1))

print("The original dictionary 2 is : " + str(test_dict2))

 

# Using items() + list comprehension + sum()

# Equal Keys List Summation

res = {key: sum(value) + sum(test_dict2[key]) for key,
value in test_dict1.items()}

 

# printing result 

print("The summation of dictionary values is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original dictionary 1 is : {'CS': [7, 8], 'for': [2, 4], 'Gfg': [1, 2, 3]}
    The original dictionary 2 is : {'CS': [0, 18], 'for': [5], 'Gfg': [10, 11]}
    The summation of dictionary values is : {'CS': 33, 'for': 11, 'Gfg': 27}
