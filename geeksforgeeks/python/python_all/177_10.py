Hangman Game in Python



Hangman is a word game in which computer will randomly select a word from the
dictionary and player has to guess it correctly in given number of turns. The
word to be guessed is represented by row of stars. If the guessed letter is
present is word, script will automatically be placed to correct places.

>  **Rules to guess the word :**
>
>   1. Input single letter in one turn.
>   2. Donâ€™t use repeated letters.
>   3. Turns will be decremented after every guess.

This is the text file used inside the code words.txt, which contains 50,000
English words.
