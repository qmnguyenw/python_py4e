Python â€“ Most common Combination in Matrix



Given a matrix, the task is to write a python program to extract the most
common occurrence of any combination of elements size greater than 2.

 **Examples:**

>  **Input:** test_list = [[4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 6, 3, 2], [4, 2, 6, 7], [1, 2, 4,
> 6]]
>
>  **Output:** [(2, 6)]
>
>  **Explanation:** [2, 6] in combination occurs 4 times, maximum of all.
>

>
>
> **Input:** test_list = [[4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 6, 3, 2], [4, 2, 6, 7], [1, 2, 4,
> 7]]
>
>  **Output:** [(2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7)]
>
>  **Explanation:** [2, 6], [2, 4] and [2, 7] in combination occur 3 times
> each, maximum of all.

**Approach:** Using combinations() \+ Counter() \+ most_common() \+ list
comprehension

In this, combinations are computed using _combinations()_ , _Counter()_ ,
keeps track of frequencies of each combination. At last, _most_common()_ is
used to extract the maximum frequency of combinations occurred.

    The original list is : [[4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 6, 3, 2], [4, 2, 6, 7], [1, 2, 4, 6]]
    The Most common combination : [(2, 6)]
