Python | Alternate element summation in list



The problem of getting summation of a list is quite generic and we might some
day face the issue of getting the summation of alternate elements and get the
list of 2 elements containing summation of alternate elements. Letâ€™s discuss
certain ways in which this can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension + list slicing +sum()**  
List slicing clubbed with list comprehension can be used to perform this
particular task. We can have list comprehension to get run the logic and list
slicing can slice out the alternate character, summation by the sum function

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# alternate elements summation

# using list comprehension + list slicing

 

# initializing list 

test_list = [2, 1, 5, 6, 8, 10]

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension + list slicing

# alternate elements summation

res = [sum(test_list[i : : 2])

 for i in
range(len(test_list)//(len(test_list)//2))]

 

# print result

print("The alternate elements summation list : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [2, 1, 5, 6, 8, 10]
    The alternate elements summation list : [15, 17]
    

**Method #2 : Using loop**  
This is the brute method to perform this particular task in which we have the
summation of alternate elements in different element indices and then return
the output list.
