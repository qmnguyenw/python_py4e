Python | Check if two lists have any element in common



Sometimes we encounter the problem of checking if one list contains any
element of another list. This kind of problems is quite popular in competitive
programming. Letâ€™s discuss various ways to achieve this particular task.

 **Method #1:** Using any()

# Python code to check if two lists

# Initialization of list

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 55]

list2 = [2, 3, 90, 22]

 

# using any function

out = any(check in list1 for check in list2)

 

# Checking condition

if out:

 print("True") 

else :

 print("False")

 **Output:**

    
    
    True
