Python | Above K elements summation



Many times we might have problem in which we need to find summation rather
than the actual numbers and more often, the result is conditioned.. Letâ€™s
discuss certain ways in which this problem can be successfully solved.

 **Method #1 : Using loop**  
This problem can easily be solved using loop with a brute force approach in
which we can just check for the sum as we iterate and append it in a new list
as we proceed forward.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Above K elements summation

# using loop

 

# initializing list 

test_list = [12, 10, 18, 15, 8, 18]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using loop

# Above K elements summation

res = 0

for idx in range(0, len(test_list)) :

 if test_list[idx] > 10:

 res += test_list[idx]

 

# print result

print("The summation of elements greater than 10 : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [12, 10, 18, 15, 8, 18]
    The summation of elements greater than 10 : 63
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension +sum()**  
The combination of these two function can also perform this particular task
efficiently and in one line. The sum function is used to perform summation of
elements.
