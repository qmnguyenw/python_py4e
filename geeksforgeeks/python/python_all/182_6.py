Python Program for Find minimum sum of factors of number



Given a number, find minimum sum of its factors.

Examples:

    
    
    Input : 12
    Output : 7
    **Explanation:**
    Following are different ways to factorize 12 and
    sum of factors in different ways.
    12 = 12 * 1 = 12 + 1 = 13
    12 = 2 * 6 = 2 + 6 = 8
    12 = 3 * 4 = 3 + 4 = 7
    12 = 2 * 2 * 3 = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7
    Therefore minimum sum is 7
    
    Input : 105
    Output : 15
