Python Program for n-th Fibonacci number



In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the
recurrence relation

    
    
    Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
    

With seed values  

    
    
    F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.

#creating an array in the function to find the nth number in fibonacci
series. [0,1,1,...]

 

def fibonacci (n):

 

 arr = [0] * (n+1)

 

 arr[1] = 1

 

 for i in range (2,n+1):

 **Output :**

    
    
    144
    

**Explanation:**

[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144]  
As we know that the Fibonacci series is the sum of the previous two terms, so
if we enter 12 as the input in the program, so we should get 144 as the
output. And that is what is the result.
