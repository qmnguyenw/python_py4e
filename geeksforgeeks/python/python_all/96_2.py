Python | Reverse Sort Row Matrix integration



Often during the problem solving we come across to many problems where we need
to reverse sort the list. But sometimes we would also want to reverse sort the
another list so that the elements of are automatically shifted and remain at
same index as the first list even after first list get reverse sorted. Letâ€™s
discuss certain ways in which this can be done.

 **Method #1 : Usingsorted() + reverse + zip() + itemgetter()**  
Combining the three functions we can possibly achieve the task. The zip
functions binds the two list together, sorted function sorts the list and
itemgetter function is used to define the metrics against which we need second
list to shift, in this case first list. The reverse sorting is handled by
reverse.

# using sorted() + zip() + itemgetter()

from operator import itemgetter

 

# initializing lists

test_list1 = [3, 4, 9, 1, 6]

test_list2 = [1, 5, 3, 6, 7]

 

# printing original lists

print ("The original list 1 is : " + str(test_list1))

print ("The original list 2 is : " + str(test_list2))

 

# using sorted() + zip() + itemgetter()

# Reverse Sort Row Matrix integration

res = [list(x) for x in
zip(*sorted(zip(test_list1, test_list2), key =
itemgetter(0), reverse = True))]

 

# printing result 

print ("The lists after integrity reverse sort : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list 1 is : [3, 4, 9, 1, 6]
    The original list 2 is : [1, 5, 3, 6, 7]
    The lists after integrity reverse sort : [[9, 6, 4, 3, 1], [3, 7, 5, 1, 6]]
    

**Method #2 : Usingsorted() + reverse + zip() \+ lambda function**  
This method performs the similar task, each function performing the similar
function, the difference is just the instead of itemgetter function, lambda
function performs the task of assigning a base to sort the list, i.e the first
list in this case. The reverse sorting is handled by reverse.
