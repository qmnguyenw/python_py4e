Python â€“ Rear elements Average in List



Sometimes, while working with data, we can have a problem in which we need to
perform the mean of all the rear element that come after K. This can be an
application in Mathematics and Data Science domain. Lets discuss certain ways
in which this task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Usingsum() \+ list comprehension**  
The combination of above functionalities can be used to perform this task. In
this, we first let the initial K element be as they are and perform sum of
rest of element and divide by number of element left.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Rear elements Average in List

# using list comprehension + sum()

 

# Initializing list

test_list = [5, 6, 4, 7, 8, 1, 10]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# Initializing K 

K = 3

 

# Rear elements Average in List

# using list comprehension + sum()

res = test_list[ : K] + [sum(test_list[K:]) /
len(test_list[K: ])]

 

# printing result 

print ("Average List after K elements : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [5, 6, 4, 7, 8, 1, 10]
    Average List after K elements : [5, 6, 4, 6.5]
    

**Method #2 : Usingmean() \+ list comprehension**  
This is yet another way in which this task can be performed. In this, we
perform the task of finding mean using mean(), rest of task is same as above
method.

# Rear elements Average in List

# using list comprehension + mean()

res = [*test_list[:K], mean(test_list[K:])]

 

# printing result 

print ("Average List after K elements : " + str(res))

    Average List after K elements : [5, 6, 4, 6.5]
