Python | Reverse All Strings in String List



Given a list, we always come across situations in which we require to apply
certain function to each element in a list. This can be easily done by
applying a loop and performing an operation to each element. But having
shorthands to solve this problem is always beneficial and helps to focus more
on important aspects of problem. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which reverse
operation on each string in string list can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension**  
This method performs the same task in the background as done by the looping
constructs. The advantage this particular method provides is that this is a
one liner and also improves code readability.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Reverse All Strings in String List

# using list comprehension

 

# initializing list 

test_list = ["geeks", "for", "geeks", "is", "best"]

 

# printing original list

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension

# Reverse All Strings in String List

res = [i[::-1] for i in test_list]

 

# printing result

print ("The reversed string list is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : ['geeks', 'for', 'geeks', 'is', 'best']
    The reversed string list is : ['skeeg', 'rof', 'skeeg', 'si', 'tseb']
    

**Method #2 : Usingmap()**  
Using map function, one can easily associate an element with the operation one
wishes to perform. This is the most elegant way to perform or solve this kind
of problems.
