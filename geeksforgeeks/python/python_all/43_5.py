Python â€“ Count of matching elements among lists (Including duplicates)



Given 2 lists, count all the elements that are similar in both the lists
including duplicated.

>  **Input** : test_list1 = [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 5], test_list2 = [5, 5, 3, 9,
> 8, 5]  
>  **Output** : 4  
>  **Explanation** : 3 repeats 2 times, and 5 two times, totalling to 4.
>
>  **Input** : test_list1 = [3, 5, 6], test_list2 = [5, 3, 9]  
>  **Output** : 2  
>  **Explanation** : 3 repeats 1 time, and 5 one time, totalling to 2.

 **Method #1 : Using loop**

This is brute way in which this task can be performed. In this, we iterate for
each element of other list while iterating for one list, and increase the
counter.

test_list1 = [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3]

test_list2 = [5, 5, 3, 9, 8]

 

# printing original lists

print("The original list 1 : " + str(test_list1))

print("The original list 2 : " + str(test_list2))

 

# using loop to iterate each element

res = 0

for ele in test_list1:

 if ele in test_list2:

 res += 1

 

# printing result 

print("All matching elements : " + str(res))

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list 1 : [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3]
    The original list 2 : [5, 5, 3, 9, 8]
    All matching elements : 3
    

**Method #2 : Using sum() + generator expression**

The combination of above methods is used to solve this problem. In this, we
count elements using sum() and generator expression performs the task of
iteration.
