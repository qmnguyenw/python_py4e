Python | Multiplication till Null value



The prefix array is quite famous in the programming world. This article would
discuss a variation of this scheme. This deals with the cumulative list
product till a False value, and again starts cumulation of product from
occurrence of True value. Letâ€™s discuss certain way in which this can be
performed.

 **Method #1 : Using Naive Method**  
In the naive method, we just construct the new list comprising of the the
product of prev. value of list until False and restarts the procedure once a
True value is encountered.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Multiplication till Null value

# using naive method 

 

# initializing list of lists

test_list = [1, 3, 4, False, 4, 5, False,
7, 8]

 

# printing original list

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# Multiplication till Null value

# using naive method

for i in range(1, len(test_list)):

 if test_list[i]: 

 test_list[i] *= test_list[i - 1]

 else:

 test_list[i] = 1

 

# printing result

print ("The computed modified new list : " + str(test_list))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [1, 3, 4, False, 4, 5, False, 7, 8]
    The computed modified new list : [1, 3, 12, 1, 4, 20, 1, 7, 56]
