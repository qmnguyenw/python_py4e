How to Zip two lists of lists in Python?



The normal zip function allows us the functionality to aggregate the values in
a container. But sometimes, we have a requirement in which we require to have
multiple lists and containing lists as index elements and we need to merge/zip
them together. This is quite uncommon problem, but solution to it can still be
handy. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which solution can be devised.

 **Method #1 : Usingmap() + __add__**  
This problem can be solved using the map function with the addition operation.
The map function performs the similar kind of function as the zip function and
in this this case can help to reach to a solution.

# using map() + __add__

 

# initializing lists

test_list1 = [[1, 3], [4, 5], [5, 6]]

test_list2 = [[7, 9], [3, 2], [3, 10]]

 

# printing original lists

print ("The original list 1 is : " + str(test_list1))

print ("The original list 2 is : " + str(test_list2))

 

# using map() + __add__

# zipping lists of lists 

res = list(map(list.__add__, test_list1, test_list2))

 

# printing result 

print ("The modified zipped list is : " + str(res))

    The original list 1 is : [[1, 3], [4, 5], [5, 6]]
    The original list 2 is : [[7, 9], [3, 2], [3, 10]]
    The modified zipped list is : [[1, 3, 7, 9], [4, 5, 3, 2], [5, 6, 3, 10]]
    

  
**Method #2 : Usingitertools.chain() + zip()**  
This combination of these two functions can be used to perform this particular
task. The chain function can be used to perform the interlist aggregation, and
the intralist aggregation is done by zip function.
