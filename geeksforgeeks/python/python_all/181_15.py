Python Program for Smallest K digit number divisible by X



Integers X and K are given. The task is to find smallest K-digit number
divisible by X.

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input :** X = 83, K = 5
    **Output :** 10043
    10040 is the smallest 5 digit
    number that is multiple of 83.
    
    **Input :** X = 5, K = 2
    **Output :** 10

An **efficient solution** would be :

    
    
    Compute MIN : smallest K-digit number (1000...K-times)
    If, MIN % X is 0, ans = MIN
    else, ans = (MIN + X) - ((MIN + X) % X))
    This is because there will be a number in 
    range [MIN...MIN+X] divisible by X.
