Python Program for Tower of Hanoi



Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks.
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod,
obeying the following simple rules:  
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.  
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and
placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the
uppermost disk on a stack.  
3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.  
Note: Transferring the top n-1 disks from source rod to Auxiliary rod can
again be thought of as a fresh problem and can be solved in the same manner.
