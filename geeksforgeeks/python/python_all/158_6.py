Backward iteration in Python



The iteration of numbers is done by looping techniques in Python. There are
many techniques in Python which facilitate looping. Sometimes we require to
perform the looping backward and having shorthands to do so can be quite
useful. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this can be done.

 **Method #1 : Usingreversed()**  
The simplest way to perform this is to use the reversed function for the for
loop and the iteration will start occurring from the rear side than the
conventional counting.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# backward iteration

# using reversed()

 

# Initializing number from which 

# iteration begins 

N = 6

 

# using reversed() to perform the back iteration

print ("The reversed numbers are : ", end = "")

for num in reversed(range(N + 1)) :

 print (num, end = " ")  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

 **Output :**

    
    
    The reversed numbers are : 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 
    

**Method #2 : Usingrange(N, -1, -1)**  
This particular task can also be performed using the conventional range
function which, if provided with the third argument performs the skip and
second argument is used to start from backwards.
