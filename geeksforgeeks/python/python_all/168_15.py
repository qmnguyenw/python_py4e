Password validation in Python



Letâ€™s take a password as a combination of alphanumeric characters along with
special characters, and check whether the password is valid or not with the
help of few conditions.

 **Conditions for a valid password are:**

  1. Should have at least one number.
  2. Should have at least one uppercase and one lowercase character.
  3. Should have at least one special symbol.
  4. Should be between 6 to 20 characters long.

    
    
    **Input :**  Geek12#
    **Output :** Password is valid.
    
    **Input :**  asd123
    **Output :** Invalid Password !!

We can check if a given string is eligible to be a password or not using
multiple ways.

 **Method #1:** Naive Method (Without using Regex).
