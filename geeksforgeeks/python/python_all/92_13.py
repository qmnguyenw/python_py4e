Python | Consecutive Custom Chunked elements Product



There are numerous ways to perform product in list the list with the elements,
but sometimes, its required to find product of the lists with the numbers in a
sliced way. This can be custom and hence knowledge of this can come handy.
Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this can be done.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +enumerate() \+ loop**  
The list comprehension can do the possible iteration part and enumerate can
help in the part of logic and checking for the valid elements required in the
list. The loop is used to perform product.

# Consecutive Custom Chunked elements Product

# using list comprehension + enumerate() + loop

 

# getting Product 

def prod(val) : 

 res = 1

 for ele in val: 

 res *= ele 

 return res 

 

# initializing lists

test_list = list(range(1, 50))

 

# printing original list

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# interval elements

N = 5

 

# interval difference

K = 15

 

# using list comprehension + enumerate() + loop

# Consecutive Custom Chunked elements Product

res = prod([i for j, i in enumerate(test_list) if j % K
< N ])

 

# printing result 

print ("The modified range product list : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

> The original list is : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
> 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,
> 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]  
> The modified range product list : 44225406378688905216000

  

  

**Method #2 : Using itertools.compress() + itertools.cycle() + loop**  
The above two function can combine to facilitate the solution of the discussed
problem. The cycle function can to the task of repetition and the compress
function can be beneficial when it comes to clubbing the segments together.
The loop is used to perform product.

func = cycle([True] * N + [False] * (K - N))

res = prod(list(compress(test_list, func)))

 

# printing result 

print ("The modified range product list : " + str(res))
