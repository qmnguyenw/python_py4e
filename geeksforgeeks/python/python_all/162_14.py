Python | Type conversion in dictionary values



The problem of conventional type conversion is quite common and can be easily
done using the built-in converters of python libraries. But sometimes, we may
require the same functionality in a more complex scenario vis. for keys of
list of dictionaries. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this can be
achieved.  

 **Method #1 : Naive Method**  
In the naive method, we employ 2 loops, nested. One for all the dictionaries
in the list and the second one for the dictionary key-value pairs in a
specific dictionary.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Type conversion in list of dicts.

# using naive method

 

# initializing list of dictionary

test_list = [{'a' : '1', 'b' : '2'}, { 'c' : '3',
'd' : '4'}]

 

# printing original list

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# using naive method

# type converstion in list of dicts.

for dicts in test_list:

 for keys in dicts:

 dicts[keys] = int(dicts[keys])

 

# printing result 

print ("The modified converted list is : " + str(test_list))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [{'a': '1', 'b': '2'}, {'c': '3', 'd': '4'}]
    The modified converted list is : [{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'c': 3, 'd': 4}]
    

**Method #2 : Usingitems() \+ list comprehension**  
This can easily performed using just a one line with the help of list
comprehension. The items function can be exploited to extract the list values
as when required and list comprehension part handles the iteration part.

res = [dict([key, int(value)] 

 for key, value in dicts.items()) 

 for dicts in test_list]

 

# printing result
