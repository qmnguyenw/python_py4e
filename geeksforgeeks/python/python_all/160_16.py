Python | Operate on every Kth element of list



We generally wish to employ a particular function to all the elements in a
list. But sometimes, according to the requirement, we would wish to employ a
particular functionality to certain elements of the list, basically to every
Kth element in list. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this can be
performed.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +enumerate()**  
The functionality of getting every Kth number of list can be done with the
help of list comprehension and enumerate function helps in the iteration of
the whole list.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Edit every Kth element in list 

# using list comprehension + enumerate()

 

# initializing list 

test_list = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12]

 

# printing the original list

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension + enumerate()

# Edit every Kth element in list 

# add 2 to every 3rd element

res = [i + 2 if j % 3 == 0 else i 

 for j, i in enumerate(test_list)]

 

# printing result

print ("The list after editing every kth element : " + str(res))

 **Output:**

    
    
    The original list is : [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12]
    The list after editing every kth element : [3, 4, 5, 8, 7, 8, 11, 12]
    

  
**Method #2 : Using list comprehension + list slicing**  
Above mentioned functions can help to perform these tasks. The list
comprehension does the task of iteration in list and list slicing does the
extraction of every Kth element.

test_list[0::3] = [i + 2 for i in test_list[0 ::
3]]

 

# printing result

print ("The list after editing every kth element : "
