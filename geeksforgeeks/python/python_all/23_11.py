Python â€“ Find the frequency of numbers greater than each element in a list



Given a list, a new list is constructed that has frequency of elements greater
than or equal to it, corresponding to each element of the list.

>  **Input** : test_list = [6, 3, 7, 1, 2, 4]  
> **Output** : [2, 4, 1, 6, 5, 3]  
> **Explanation** : 6, 7 are greater or equal to 6 in list, hence 2.  
>  **Input** : test_list = [6, 3, 7]  
> **Output** : [2, 3, 1]  
> **Explanation** : 6, 7 are greater or equal to 6 in list, hence 2.

**Method 1 :** _Using_ _sum()_ _and_ _list comprehension_

Here, nested list comprehension is used to access each element of the list and
sum() is used to get summation of elements which are greater than or equal to
the indexed element.

for sub in test_list]
