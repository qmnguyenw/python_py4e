Python | Remove given element from list of lists



The deletion of elementary elements from list has been dealt with many times,
but sometimes rather than having just a one list, we have list of list where
we need to perform this particular task. Having shorthands to perform this
particular task can help. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways to perform this
particular task.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension**

The logic behind this kind of method is to reduce the size of code and do the
task to perform using loops as a way of list comprehension itself.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Removing element from list of lists

# using list comprehension

 

# initializing list

test_list = [[4, 5, 6], [5, 6, 4, 1],
[4], [4, 8, 9, 10]]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing Number to delete

N = 4

 

# using list comprehension

# Removing element from list of lists

res = [[ele for ele in sub if ele != N] for sub in
test_list]

 

# print result

print("The list after deletion of element : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [[4, 5, 6], [5, 6, 4, 1], [4], [4, 8, 9, 10]]
    The list after deletion of element : [[5, 6], [5, 6, 1], [], [8, 9, 10]]
    

  

  

**Method 2 : Using list comprehension + list slicing**  
In this method, we generally do the task similar to the above method, the
variation is just we use list slicing for better code readability.

for sub in test_list:

 sub[:] = [ele for ele in sub if ele != N]

 

# print result

print("The list after deletion of element : " + str(test_list))

    The list after deletion of element : [[5, 6], [5, 6, 1], [], [8, 9, 10]]
