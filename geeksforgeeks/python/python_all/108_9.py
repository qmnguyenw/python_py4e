Python | Exponentiation by K in list



While working with the python lists, we can come over a situation in which we
require to exponent constant to each element in the list. We possibly need to
iterate and exponent constant to each element but that would increase the line
of code. Letâ€™s discuss certain shorthands to perform this task.

 **Method #1 : Using List Comprehension**  
List comprehension is just the short way to perform the task we perform using
the naive method. This is mainly useful to save time and also is best among
others when it comes to readability of the code.

# Exponentiation by K in list

# using list comprehension

 

# initializing list 

test_list = [4, 5, 6, 3, 9]

 

# printing original list

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing K

K = 4

 

# using list comprehension

# Exponentiation by K in list

res = [x ** K for x in test_list]

 

# printing result 

print ("The list after constant exponentiation : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [4, 5, 6, 3, 9]
    The list after constant exponentiation : [256, 625, 1296, 81, 6561]
    

**Method #2 : Usingmap() + operator.pow**  
This is similar to the above function but uses the operator.pow to exponent
each element to other element from the other list of K formed before applying
the map function. It powers the similar index elements of list.
