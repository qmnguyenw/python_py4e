Python | Extract suffix after K



Sometimes, we might have a use case in which we need to find a suffix in
string. But sometimes, the requirement can be something dynamic like a
specific input character than number of elements for the decision of getting
suffix.  
Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which we can find suffix of string after a
certain character.

 **Method #1 : Usingrsplit()**  
This method originally performs the task of splitting the string from the rear
end rather than the conventional left to right fashion. This can though be
limited to 1, for solving this particular problem.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Extract suffix after K

# Using rsplit()

 

# initializing string 

test_str = "GeeksforGeeks"

 

# initializing split character

spl_char = "r"

 

# printing original string 

print("The original string is : " + str(test_str))

 

# Using rsplit()

# Extract suffix after K

res = test_str.rsplit(spl_char, 1)[1]

 

# printing result 

print("The suffix string is : " + str(res))  
  
---

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original string is : GeeksforGeeks
    The suffix string is : Geeks
    

**Method #2 : Usingrpartition()**  
If we need to solve this particular problem, this inbuilt function is
recommended to perform this particular task. This function performs the
partition as required just once from the rear end.

res = test_str.rpartition(spl_char)[2]

 

# printing result 

print("The suffix string is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original string is : GeeksforGeeks
    The suffix string is : Geeks
