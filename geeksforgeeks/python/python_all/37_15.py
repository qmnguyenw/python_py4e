Python â€“ Skew Nested Tuple Summation



Given a Tuple, nesting at 2nd position, return summation of 1st elements.

>  **Input** : test_tup = (5, (6, (1, (9, None))))  
>  **Output** : 21  
>  **Explanation** : 9 + 6 + 5 + 1 = 21.
>
>  **Input** : test_tup = (5, (6, (1, None)))  
>  **Output** : 12  
>  **Explanation** : 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.

 **Method #1 : Using infinite loop**

In this, we perform get into skew structure while summation using infinite
loop and break when we reach None value.

res = 0

while test_tup:

 res += test_tup[0]

 

 # assigning inner tuple as original

 test_tup = test_tup[1]

 

# printing result 

print("Summation of 1st positions : " + str(res))

    The original tuple is : (5, (6, (1, (9, (10, None)))))
    Summation of 1st positions : 31
    
    

**Method #2 : Using recursion**

In this, we perform summation and recur for the 2nd element of tuple, return
on None.
