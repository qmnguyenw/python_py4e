Python | Alternate Sort in String list



Sometimes, while working with Python list, we can have a problem in which we
need to perform sorting only of alternatively in list. This kind of
application can come many times. Letâ€™s discuss certain way in which this task
can be performed.

 **Method : Usingjoin() + enumerate() \+ generator expression + sorted()**  
This task can be achieved by using combination of functionalities above. In
this, we perform the sort using just %2 elements in String list. The extension
of this operation to entire list is performed by generator expression.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Alternate Sort String list 

# using join() + enumerate() + generator expression + sorted()

 

# initialize list 

test_list = ['cdab', 'gfeh', 'kjil']

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# Alternate Sort String list 

# using join() + enumerate() + generator expression + sorted()

res = ["".join(sorted(j, reverse = i % 2)) for i, j
in enumerate(test_list)] 

 

# printing result

print("The String list after alternate sorting : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : ['cdab', 'gfeh', 'kjil']
    The String list after alternate sorting : ['abcd', 'hgfe', 'ijkl']
