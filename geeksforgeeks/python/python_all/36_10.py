Python â€“ Restrict Elements Frequency in List



Given a List, and elements frequency list, restrict frequency of elements in
list from frequency list.

>  **Input** : test_list = [1, 4, 5, 4, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6], restrct_dict = {4 :
> 3, 1 : 1, 6 : 1, 5 : 1}  
>  **Output** : [1, 4, 5, 4, 4, 6]  
>  **Explanation** : Limit of 1 is 1, any occurrance more than that is
> removed. Similar with all elements.

>  **Input** : test_list = [1, 4, 5, 4, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6], restrct_dict = {4 :
> 2, 1 : 1, 6 : 1, 5 : 1}  
>  **Output** : [1, 4, 5, 4, 6]  
>  **Explanation** : Limit of 4 is 3, any occurrance more than that is
> removed. Similar with all elements.

 **Method : Using loop + defaultdict()**

In this, we iterate for elements and and maintain lookup counter for each
element using defauldict(), if any element exceeds restrict dict, that element
is not added then onwards.

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list is : [1, 4, 5, 4, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]
    Filtered List : [1, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 6]
