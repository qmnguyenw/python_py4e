Python | Indices of N largest elements in list



Sometimes, while working with Python lists, we can have a problem in which we
wish to find N largest elements. This task can occur in many domains such as
web development and while working with Databases. We might sometimes, require
to just find the indices of them. Letâ€™s discuss certain way to find indices of
N largest elements in list.

 **Method : Usingsorted() \+ lambda + list slicing**  
This task can be performed using the combination of above functions. In this
the sorted(), can be used to get the container in way which requires to get
N largest elements at rear end and then the indices can be computed using list
slicing.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Indices of N largest elements in list

# using sorted() + lambda + list slicing

 

# initialize list

test_list = [5, 6, 10, 4, 7, 1, 19]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# initialize N 

N = 4

 

# Indices of N largest elements in list

# using sorted() + lambda + list slicing

res = sorted(range(len(test_list)), key = lambda sub:
test_list[sub])[-N:]

 

# printing result

print("Indices list of max N elements is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [5, 6, 10, 4, 7, 1, 19]
    Indices list of max N elements is : [1, 4, 2, 6]
