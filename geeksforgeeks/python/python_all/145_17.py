Python | Assign range of elements to List



Assigning elements to list is a common problem and many varieties of it have
been discussed in the previous articles. This particular article discusses the
insertion of range of elements in the list. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in
which this problem can be solved.

 **Method #1 : Usingextend()**  
This can be solved using the extend function in which the insertion of range
of numbers can be done on the rear end using the range function.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Assigning range of elements to List

# using extend()

 

# initializing list

test_list = [3, 5, 6, 8]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using extend()

# Assigning range of elements to List

test_list.extend(range(6))

 

# print result

print("The list after adding range elements : " + str(test_list))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [3, 5, 6, 8]
    The list after adding range elements : [3, 5, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    

**Method #2 Using* operator**  
This problem can also be solved using the * operator and with the advantage of
flexibility of addition of elements at any position.

    The original list : [3, 5, 6, 8]
    The list after adding range elements : [3, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
