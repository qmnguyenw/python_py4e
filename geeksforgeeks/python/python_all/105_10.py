Python | Harmonic Mean of List



While working with Python, we can have a problem in which we need to find
harmonic mean of a list cumulative. This problem is common in Data Science
domain. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this problem can be solved.

 **Method #1 : Using loop + formula**  
The simpler manner to approach this problem is to employ the formula for
finding harmonic mean and perform using loop shorthands. This is the most
basic approach to solve this problem.

# Harmonic Mean of List

# using loop + formula

 

# initialize list

test_list = [6, 7, 3, 9, 10, 15]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# Harmonic Mean of List

# using loop + formula

sum = 0

for ele in test_list:

 sum += 1 / ele 

res = len(test_list)/sum

 

# printing result

print("The harmonic mean of list is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [6, 7, 3, 9, 10, 15]
    The harmonic mean of list is : 6.517241379310345
    

**Method #2 : Usingstatistics.harmonic_mean()**  
This task can also be performed using inbuilt function of harmonic_mean().
This is new in Python versions >= 3.8.
