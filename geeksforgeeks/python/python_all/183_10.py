Python Program to Check Prime Number



Given a positive integer, check if the number is prime or not. A prime is a
natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and
itself. Examples of first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5,

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 11
    **Output:** true
    
    **Input:**  n = 15
    **Output:** false
    
    **Input:**  n = 1
    **Output:** false
