Python | Product of Prefix in list



Nowdays, especially in the field of competitive programming, the utility of
computing prefix product is quite popular and features in many problems.
Hence, having a one liner solution to it would possess a great help. Letâ€™s
discuss certain way in which this problem can be solved.

 **Method : Using list comprehension + list slicing**  
This problem can be solved using the combination of above two functions in
which we use list comprehension to extend logic to each element and then later
compute the product, slicing is used to get product till the particular index.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Product of Prefix in list

# using list comprehension + list slicing 

 

# compute prod

def prod(test_list):

 res = 1

 for ele in test_list:

 res = res * ele

 return res

 

# initializing list

test_list = [3, 4, 1, 7, 9, 1]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension + list slicing

# Product of Prefix in list

res = [prod(test_list[ : i + 1 ]) for i in
range(len(test_list))]

 

# print result

print("The prefix prod list is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [3, 4, 1, 7, 9, 1]
    The prefix prod list is : [3, 12, 12, 84, 756, 756]
