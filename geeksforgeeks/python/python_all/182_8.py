Python Program for GCD of more than two (or array) numbers



The GCD of three or more numbers equals the product of the prime factors
common to all the numbers, but it can also be calculated by repeatedly taking
the GCDs of pairs of numbers.

    
    
    gcd(a, b, c) = gcd(a, gcd(b, c)) 
                 = gcd(gcd(a, b), c) 
                 = gcd(gcd(a, c), b)
