Python â€“ Elements frequency in Tuple



Given a Tuple, find frequency of each element.

>  **Input** : test_tup = (4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5)  
>  **Output** : {4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 2}  
>  **Explanation** : Frequency of 4 is 2 and so on..
>
>  **Input** : test_tup = (4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6)  
>  **Output** : {4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 3}  
>  **Explanation** : Frequency of 4 is 2 and so on..

 **Method #1 Using defaultdict()**

In this, we perform task of getting all elements and assigning frequency using
defauldict which maps each element with key and then frequency can be
incremented.

# Using defaultdict()

from collections import defaultdict

 

# initializing tuple

test_tup = (4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 5,
4)

 

# printing original tuple

print("The original tuple is : " + str(test_tup))

 

res = defaultdict(int)

for ele in test_tup:

 

 # incrementing frequency

 res[ele] += 1

 

# printing result 

print("Tuple elements frequency is : " + str(dict(res)))

**Output**

    
    
    The original tuple is : (4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4)
    Tuple elements frequency is : {4: 3, 5: 4, 6: 2}
    

**Method #2 : Using Counter()**

This is straight forward way to solve this problem. In this, we just employ
this function and it returns frequency of elements in container, in this case
tuple.
