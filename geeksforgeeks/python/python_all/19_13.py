Python â€“ Rows with all List elements



Given a Matrix, get all the rows with all the list elements.

>  **Input** : test_list = [[7, 6, 3, 2], [5, 6], [2, 1, 8], [6, 1, 2]],
> sub_list = [1, 2]  
> **Output** : [[2, 1, 8], [6, 1, 2]]  
> **Explanation** : Extracted lists have 1 and 2.
>
>  **Input** : test_list = [[7, 6, 3, 2], [5, 6], [2, 1, 8], [6, 1, 2]],
> sub_list = [2, 6]  
> **Output** : [[7, 6, 3, 2], [6, 1, 2]]  
> **Explanation** : Extracted lists have 2 and 6.

 **Method #1: Using loop**

In this, we iterate for each row from Matrix, and check for presence of each
list element, if present row is returned as result. If any element is not
present, row is flagged off.

# Using loop

 

# initializing list

test_list = [[7, 6, 3, 2], [5, 6], [2, 1,
8], [6, 1, 2]]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing list

sub_list = [1, 2]

 

res = []

for row in test_list:

 

 flag = True

 

 # checking for all elements in list

 for ele in sub_list:

 if ele not in row:

 flag = False

 

 if flag:

 res.append(row)

 

# printing result

print("Rows with list elements : " + str(res))  
  
---

 **Output:**

> The original list is : [[7, 6, 3, 2], [5, 6], [2, 1, 8], [6, 1, 2]]  
> Rows with list elements : [[2, 1, 8], [6, 1, 2]]

 **Method #2 : Using** **all()** **+** **list comprehension**

In this, all elements for presence as tested using all(), list comprehension
is used as a one-liner to perform the task of iterating through rows.
