Python | Find the list elements starting with specific letter



Sometimes, we require to get the words that start with the specific letter.
This kind of use case is quiet common in the places of common programming
projects or competitive programming. Letâ€™s discuss certain shorthands to deal
with this problem in Python.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +lower()**

This problem can be solved using the combination of above two functions, list
comprehension performs the task of extending the logic to whole list and lower
function checks for case insensitivity with the target word of argument
letter.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Words starting with specific letter

# using list comprehension + lower()

 

# initializing list

test_list = ['Akash', 'Nikhil', 'Manjeet', 'akshat']

 

# initializing check letter

check = 'A'

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension + lower()

# Words starting with specific letter

res = [idx for idx in test_list if idx[0].lower() ==
check.lower()]

 

# print result

print("The list of matching first letter : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : ['Akash', 'Nikhil', 'Manjeet', 'akshat']
    The list of matching first letter : ['Akash', 'akshat']
    

  

  

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension +startswith() + lower()**

This method is similar to the above method but rather than checking for
equality with operator, it checks using the startswith function which is
inbuilt provided by python inbuilt library.
