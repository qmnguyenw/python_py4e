Examples:

    
    
    Input : arr[] = {12, 10, 5, 6, 52, 36}
                k = 2
    Output : arr[] = {5, 6, 52, 36, 12, 10}
    Explanation : Split from index 2 and first 
    part {12, 10} add to the end .
    
    Input : arr[] = {3, 1, 2}
               k = 1
    Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
    Explanation : Split from index 1 and first
    part add to the end.
