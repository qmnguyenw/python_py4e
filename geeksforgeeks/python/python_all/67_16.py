SpongeBob Mocking Text Generator â€“ Python



SpongeBob mocking text (spongemock) is a style of writing in which the
alphabets are randomly written in upper and lower case. It is used in internet
communities to mock something. The text originated as a meme from the
SpongeBob cartoon series.

 **Examples :**

    
    
    **Input :** The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    **Output :** tHE QuiCK BrOWN fOX juMps over tHe lAzY dOG.
    
    **Input :** This sentence is to test the function.
    **Output :** This seNtENce is TO TeST THE funcTiON.
    

**Algorithm :**

  1. Process the input string by character.
  2. Check if the character is an alphabet by using isalpha() method.
  3. Use random.random() method to generate a random number between 0 and 1.
  4. If the number generated is greater than 0.5 then change the character to upper case using upper() method.
  5. If the number generated is less than or equal to 0.5 then change the character to lower case using lower() method.

The above code generates the text with equal amount if lower and upper case
characters. If we want to skew the balance to favour one side we can switch
the random.random() method with random.triangular() method.
