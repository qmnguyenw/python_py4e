Python | K occurrence element Test



There are many common problems that a developer or common programmer comes
across in day-day coding. One such problem is finding if an element occurs a
certain number of times in list. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways to deal with this
problem.

 **Method #1 : Usingsum() \+ list comprehension**  
The list comprehension can be clubbed with the sum function for achieving this
particular task. The sum function does the summation part and the logical case
of returning true is dealt in list comprehension part.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# K occurrence element Test

# using sum() + list comprehension

 

# initializing list

test_list = [1, 3, 5, 5, 4, 5]

 

# printing original list

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing k 

k = 3

 

# initializing N

N = 5

 

# using sum() + list comprehension

# K occurrence element Test 

res = 0

res = sum([1 for i in test_list if i == N]) ==
k

if res == 1 :

 res = True

else : 

 res = False

 

# printing result 

print ("Does N occur K times ? : " + str(res))  
  
---

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [1, 3, 5, 5, 4, 5]
    Does N occur K times ? : True
    

**Method #2 : Usingnext() + islice()**  
These both functions can be used together to perform this particular task in
more efficient manner than above. The islice function would handle the
summation part and next function helps with iteration logic.

# using next() + islice()

# K occurrence element Test

func = (True for i in test_list if i == N)

res = next(islice(func, k - 1, None), False)

 

# printing result 

print ("Does N occur K times ? : " + str(res))

    Does N occur K times ? : True
