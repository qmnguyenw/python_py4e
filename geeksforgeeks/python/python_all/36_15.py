Python â€“ Extract elements from Ranges in List



Given a list, and a list of tuples with ranges, extract all elements in those
ranges from list.

>  **Input** : test_list = [4, 5, 4, 6, 7, 5, 4, 5, 6, 10], range_list = [(2,
> 4), (7, 8)]  
>  **Output** : [4, 6, 7, 5, 6]  
>  **Explanation** : 4, 6, 7 are elements at idx 2, 3, 4 and 5, 6 at idx 7, 8.
>
>  **Input** : test_list = [4, 5, 4, 6, 7, 5, 4, 5, 6, 10], range_list = [(2,
> 6)]  
>  **Output** : [4, 6, 7, 5, 4]  
>  **Explanation** : Elements from 2-6 index are extracted.

 **Method #1 : Using loop + list slicing**

In this, we extract each range using list slicing and using loop iterate for
each range and keep extending the extracting slices to extending list.

4, 6, 4, 6, 9, 8]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing ranges

range_list = [(2, 4), (7, 8), (10, 12)]

 

res = []

for ele in range_list:

 

 # extending ranges

 res.extend(test_list[ele[0] : ele[1] + 1])

 

# printing result 

print("Ranges elements : " + str(res))

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list is : [4, 5, 4, 6, 7, 5, 4, 5, 4, 6, 4, 6, 9, 8]
    Ranges elements : [4, 6, 7, 5, 4, 4, 6, 9]
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension**

In this, we apply similar method as above function, difference being that list
comprehension is used to solve this in compact form.
