Python Program for Activity Selection Problem | Greedy Algo-1



 _You are given n activities with their start and finish times. Select the
maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person,
assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time._  
Example:

    
    
    **Example 1 :** Consider the following 3 activities sorted
    by finish time.
         start[]  =  {10, 12, 20};
         finish[] =  {20, 25, 30};
    A person can perform at most **two** activities. The 
    maximum set of activities that can be executed 
    is {0, 2} [ These are indexes in start[] and 
    finish[] ]
    
    **Example 2 :** Consider the following 6 activities 
    sorted by by finish time.
         start[]  =  {1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5};
         finish[] =  {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9};
    A person can perform at most **four** activities. The 
    maximum set of activities that can be executed 
    is {0, 1, 3, 4} [ These are indexes in start[] and 
    finish[] ]
