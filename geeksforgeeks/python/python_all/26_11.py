Python â€“ Test if list is Palindrome



Given a List, check if its palindrome.

> **Input** : test_list = [4, 5, 4]  
> **Output** : True  
> **Explanation** : List is same from front and rear.
>
>  **Input** : test_list = [4, 5, 5]  
> **Output** : True  
> **Explanation** : List is not same from front and rear.

**Method #1: Using** **list slicing**

In this, we extract first and reversed 2nd half of list, and then compare for
equality, if found equal, then we conclude its palindrome.

test_list = [1, 4, 5, 4, 1]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# Reversing the list

reverse = test_list[::-1]

 

# checking if palindrome

res = test_list == reverse

 

# printing result 

print("Is list Palindrome : " + str(res))

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list is : [1, 4, 5, 4, 1]
    Is list Palindrome : True
    

**Method #2 : Using** **reversed()**

In this, we simply reverse the list and check if both original list and
reversed list is similar.
