Python | Kth index character similar Strings



Sometimes, we require to get the words that have Kth index with the specific
letter. This kind of use case is quiet common in the places of common
programming projects or competitive programming. Letâ€™s discuss certain
shorthand to deal with this problem in Python.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +lower()**  
This problem can be solved using the combination of above two functions, list
comprehension performs the task of extending the logic to whole list and lower
function checks for case insensitivity with the target word of argument
letter.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Kth index character similar Strings

# using list comprehension + lower()

 

# initializing list

test_list = ['Akash', 'Nikhil', 'Manjeet', 'akshat']

 

# initializing check letter

check = 'k'

 

# initializing K 

K = 2

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension + lower()

# Kth index character similar Strings

res = [idx for idx in test_list if idx[K - 1].lower()
== check.lower()]

 

# print result

print("The list of matching Kth letter : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : ['Akash', 'Nikhil', 'Manjeet', 'akshat']
    The list of matching Kth letter : ['Akash', 'akshat']
