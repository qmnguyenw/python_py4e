Python program for addition and subtraction of complex numbers



Given two complex numbers z1 and z2. The task is to add and subtract the given
complex numbers.

 **Addition of complex number:** In Python, complex numbers can be added using
+ operator.

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input:**  2+3i, 4+5i
    **Output:** Addition is : 6+8i
    
    **Input:** 2+3i, 1+2i
    **Output:** Addition is : 3+5i

# adding

def addComplex( z1, z2):

 return z1 + z2

 

# Driver's code

z1 = complex(2, 3)

z2 = complex(1, 2)

print( "Addtion is : ", addComplex(z1, z2))

 **Output:**

    
    
    Addtion is :  (3+5j)
    

**Subtraction of complex numbers:** Complex numbers in Python can be
subtracted using - operator.

  

  

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input:** 2+3i, 4+5i
    **Output:** Subtraction is : -2-2i
    
    **Input:** 2+3i, 1+2i
    **Output:** Subtraction is : 1+1i
