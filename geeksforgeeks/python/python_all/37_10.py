Python â€“ Extract Kth element of every Nth tuple in List



Given list of tuples, extract Kth column element of every Nth tuple.

>  **Input** :test_list = [(4, 5, 3), (3, 4, 7), (4, 3, 2), (4, 7, 8), (6, 4,
> 7), (2, 5, 7), (1, 9, 10), (3, 5, 7)], K = 2, N = 3  
>  **Output** : [3, 8, 10]  
>  **Explanation** : From 0th, 3rd, and 6th tuple, 2nd elements are 3, 8, 10.

>  **Input** :test_list = [(4, 5, 3), (3, 4, 7), (4, 3, 2), (4, 7, 8), (6, 4,
> 7), (2, 5, 7), (1, 9, 10), (3, 5, 7)], K = 0, N = 3  
>  **Output** : [4, 4, 1]  
>  **Explanation** : From 0th, 3rd, and 6th tuple, 0th elements are 4, 4, 1.

 **Method #1 : Using loop**

In this, we iterate by skipping N values using 3rd parameter of range(), and
append every Kth value in list using loop.

2), (4, 7, 8),

 (6, 4, 7), (2, 5, 7), (1, 9, 10),
(3, 5, 7)]

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing K

K = 1

 

# initializing N 

N = 3

 

res = []

for idx in range(0, len(test_list), N):

 

 # extract Kth element

 res.append(test_list[idx][K])

 

# printing result 

print("The extracted elements : " + str(res))

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list is : [(4, 5, 3), (3, 4, 7), (4, 3, 2), (4, 7, 8), (6, 4, 7), (2, 5, 7), (1, 9, 10), (3, 5, 7)]
    The extracted elements : [5, 7, 9]
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension**

In this, we perform task of extracted elements using one-liner using list
comprehension, using same method as above.
