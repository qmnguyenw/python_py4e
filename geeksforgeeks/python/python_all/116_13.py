Python | Retain K consecutive elements



Sometimes while working with data, we can have a problem in which we need to
select some of the elements that occur K times consecutively. This problem can
occur in many domains. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this problem can be
solved.

 **Method #1 : Usinggroupby() \+ list comprehension**  
This task can be performed using above functionalities. In this, we group all
the numbers that are occurring K consecutively. We iterate the list using list
comprehension.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Retain K consecutive elements

# using groupby() + list comprehension

from itertools import groupby

 

# initialize list 

test_list = [1, 1, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7,
8]

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# initialize K 

K = 2

 

# Retain K consecutive elements

# using groupby() + list comprehension

res = [i for i, j in groupby(test_list) if len(list(j))
== K]

 

# printing result

print("The K consecutive elements are : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [1, 1, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8]
    The K consecutive elements are : [1, 5, 7]
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension +slice() + groupby()**  
This task can also be performed using above functions. In this, we just
perform grouping in similar way as above but the way we extract consecutive
elements is by slice().

res = [i for i, j in groupby(test_list) if
len(list(islice(j, 0, K))) == K]

 

# printing result

print("The K consecutive elements are : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [1, 1, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8]
    The K consecutive elements are : [1, 5, 7]
