Python program to print all Prime numbers in an Interval



Given two positive integers start and end. The task is to write a Python
program to print all Prime numbers in an Interval.  
 **Definition:** A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no
positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2,
3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.  
The idea to solve this problem is to iterate the _val_ from _start_ to _end_
using a for loop and for every number, if it is greater than 1, check if it
divides _n_. If we find any other number which divides, print that value.  
Below is the Python implementation:

# Python program to print all

# prime number in an interval

# number should be greater than 1

start = 11

end = 25

 

for i in range(start, end+1):

 if i>1:

 for j in range(2,i):

 if(i % j==0):

 break

 else:

 print(i)

 **Output:**  

    
    
    11
    13
    17
    19
    23
    
    

The above solution can be optimized using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Please
