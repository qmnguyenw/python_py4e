Python | Least Value test in Dictionary



While working with dictionary, we might come to a problem in which we require
to ensure that all the values are atleast K in dictionary. This kind of
problem can occur while checking status of start or checking for a bug/action
that could have occurred. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this task can be
performed.

 **Method #1 : Usingall() \+ dictionary comprehension**  
The combination of above functions can be used to perform the following task.
The all function checks for each key and dictionary comprehension checks for
the atleast K value.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Least Value test in Dictionary

# Using all() + dictionary comprehension

 

# Initialize dictionary

test_dict = {'gfg' : 8, 'is' : 10, 'best' : 11}

 

# Printing original dictionary 

print("The original dictionary is : " + str(test_dict))

 

# Initialize K 

K = 8

 

# using all() + dictionary comprehension

# Least Value test in Dictionary

res = all(x >= K for x in test_dict.values())

 

# printing result 

print("Does all keys have atleast K value ? : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original dictionary is : {'gfg': 8, 'best': 11, 'is': 10}
    Does all keys have atleast K value ? : True
    

**Method #2 : Using loop**  
This problem can be solved using brute force strategy using loop and we
compare each key with K and return True if all elements are atleast K.
