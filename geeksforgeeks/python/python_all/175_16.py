Python program to add two numbers



Given two numbers num1 and num2. The task is to write a Python program to find
the addition of these two numbers.

 **Examples:**

    
    
    Input: num1 = 5, num2 = 3
    Output: 8
    
    Input: num1 = 13, num2 = 6
    Output: 19

In the below program to add two numbers, the user is first asked to enter two
numbers and the input is scanned using the input() function and stored in the
variables number1 and number2. Then, the variables number1 and number2 are
added using the arithmetic operator + and the result is stored in the variable
sum.

Below is the Python program to add two numbers:

Example 1:

  

  

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# Python3 program to add two numbers

 

num1 = 15

num2 = 12

 

# Adding two nos

sum = num1 + num2

 

# printing values

print("Sum of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(num1, num2, sum))  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output:

    
    
    Sum of 15 and 12 is 27

 **Example 2:** Adding two number provided by user input

 __

 __  
 __

 __

 __  
 __  
 __

# Python3 program to add two numbers

 

number1 = input("First number: ")

number2 = input("\nSecond number: ")

 

# Adding two numbers

# User might also enter float numbers

sum = float(number1) + float(number2)

 

# Display the sum

# will print value in float

print("The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(number1, number2,
sum))  
  
---  
  
 __

 __

Output:

    
    
    First number: 13.5 Second number: 1.54
    The sum of 13.5 and 1.54 is 15.04
