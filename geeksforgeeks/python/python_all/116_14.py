Python | Extract K sized strings



Sometimes, while working with huge amount of data, we can have a problem in
which we need to extract just specific sized strings. This kind of problem can
occur during validation cases across many domains. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways
to handle this in Python strings list.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +len()**  
The combination of above functionalities can be used to perform this task. In
this, we iterate for all the strings and return only K sized strings checked
using len().

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Extract K sized strings

# using list comprehension + len()

 

# initialize list 

test_list = ['gfg', 'is', 'best', 'for', 'geeks']

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# initialize K 

K = 3

 

# Extract K sized strings

# using list comprehension + len()

res = [ele for ele in test_list if len(ele) == K]

 

# printing result

print("The K sized strings are : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : ['gfg', 'is', 'best', 'for', 'geeks']
    The K sized strings are : ['gfg', 'for']
    

**Method #2 : Usingfilter() \+ lambda**  
The combination of above functionalities can be used to perform this task. In
this, we extract the elements using filter() and logic is compiled in a lambda
function.

# using filter() + lambda

res = list(filter(lambda ele: len(ele) == K,
test_list))

 

# printing result

print("The K sized strings are : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : ['gfg', 'is', 'best', 'for', 'geeks']
    The K sized strings are : ['gfg', 'for']
