Python | Multiplying Alternate elements in List



The problem of getting product of a list is quite generic and we might some
day face the issue of getting the product of alternate elements and get the
list of 2 elements containing product of alternate elements. Letâ€™s discuss
certain ways in which this can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension + list slicing + loop**  
List slicing clubbed with list comprehension can be used to perform this
particular task. We can have list comprehension to get run the logic and list
slicing can slice out the alternate character, product by the external prod
function.

# getting Product 

def prod(val) : 

 res = 1

 for ele in val: 

 res *= ele 

 return res 

 

# initializing list 

test_list = [2, 1, 5, 6, 8, 10]

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension + list slicing

# Multiplying Alternate elements in List

res = [prod(test_list[i : : 2]) for i in
range(len(test_list) // (len(test_list)//2))]

 

# print result

print("The alternate elements product list : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [2, 1, 5, 6, 8, 10]
    The alternate elements product list : [80, 60]
    

**Method #2 : Using loop**  
This is the brute method to perform this particular task in which we have the
product of alternate elements in different element indices and then return the
output list.
