Python Program for Product of unique prime factors of a number



Given a number n, we need to find the product of all of its unique prime
factors. Prime factors: It is basically a factor of the number that is a prime
number itself.

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = 10
    **Output:** Product is 10
    **Explanation:**
    Here, the input number is 10 having only 2 prime factors and they are 5 and 2.
    And hence their product is 10.
    
    **Input :** num = 25
    **Output:** Product is 5
    **Explanation:**
    Here, for the input to be 25  we have only one unique prime factor i.e 5.
    And hence the required product is 5.
    

**Method 1 (Simple)**  
Using a loop from i = 2 to n and check if i is a factor of n then check if i
is prime number itself if yes then store product in product variable and
continue this process till i = n.

def productPrimeFactors(n):

 product = 1

 

 for i in range(2, n+1):

 if (n % i == 0):

 isPrime = 1

 

 for j in range(2, int(i/2 + 1)):

 if (i % j == 0):

 isPrime = 0

 break

 

 # condition if \'i\' is Prime number

 # as well as factor of num

 if (isPrime):

 product = product * i

 

 return product 

 

 

 

# main()

n = 44

print (productPrimeFactors(n))

 **Output:**

    
    
    22
    

**Method 2 (Efficient) :**  
The idea is based on Efficient program to print all prime factors of a given
number
