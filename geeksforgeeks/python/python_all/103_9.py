Python | List Inversions



Sometimes, while programming, we have a problem in which we might need to
perform certain bitwise operations among list elements. This is an essential
utility as we come across bitwise operations many times. Letâ€™s discuss certain
ways in which this task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Usingmap() + lambda + "~" operator**  
The above functions can be combined to perform this task. We can employ map()
to accumulate the result of Inversion logic specified by the lambda function.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# List Inversions

# Using map() + lambda + "~" operator

 

# initializing list

test_list = [7, 8, 9, 1, 10, 7]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# List Inversions

# Using map() + lambda + "~" operator

res = list(map(lambda x: ~x, test_list)) 

 

# printing result 

print("The Bitwise Inversions of list elements are : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [7, 8, 9, 1, 10, 7]
    The Bitwise Inversions of list elements are : [-8, -9, -10, -2, -11, -8]
    

**Method #2 : Usingmap() + operator.invert**  
This task can also be performed using this method. In this the task performed
by lambda function in above method is performed using ior function for
cumulative Inversion operation.
