Python â€“ Nearest occurrence between two elements in a List



Given a list and two elements, _x_ and _y_ find the nearest occurrence index
of element _x_ from element _y_.

>  **Input** : test_list = [2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 6, 3, 8, 7, 2, 0, 9, 4, 9, 4], x =
> 4, y = 6  
> **Output** : 1  
> **Explanation** : 4 is found at 1, 12 and 14th index, 6 is at 5th index,
> nearest is 1st index.
>
>  **Input** : test_list = [2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 6, 3, 8, 7, 2, 0, 9, 4, 9, 4], x =
> 7, y = 6  
> **Output** : 3  
> **Explanation** : 7 is found at 3rd and 8th index, 6 is at 5th index,
> nearest is 3rd index.

**Method : Using list comprehension + loop + index()**

In this, we find all indices of _y_ using list comprehension, and then get
index of _x_ using _index()_ , post that loop is used to get index difference,
the nearest index is returned as result.

 **Output:**

> The original list is : [2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 6, 3, 8, 4, 2, 0, 9, 4, 9, 4]  
> Minimum distance index: 8
