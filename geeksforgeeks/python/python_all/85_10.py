Python â€“ List with most unique elements



Sometimes, while working with data, we can have a problem in which we need to
compute the list which has most number of unique elements. This can have
application in many domains. Lets discuss certain ways in which this task can
be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +max() + set()**  
The combination of above functionalities can be used to solve this problem. In
this, we compute the maximum occurring elements using max() and reduce the
logic to uniqueness using set().

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# List with most unique elements

# using list comprehension + max() + set()

 

# Initializing lists

test_list1 = [1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2,
2, 1]

test_list2 = [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]

test_list3 = [4, 5, 4, 3, 6, 7, 8]

 

# printing original lists

print("The original list 1 is : " + str(test_list1))

print("The original list 2 is : " + str(test_list2))

print("The original list 3 is : " + str(test_list3))

 

# List with most unique elements

# using list comprehension + max() + set()

res = [ele for ele in [set(test_list1), set(test_list2),
set(test_list3)]

 if len(ele) == max([len(sub) for sub in
[set(test_list1), set(test_list2), set(test_list3)]])][0]

 

# printing result 

print ("List with Most unique values : " + str(list(res)))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list 1 is : [1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1]
    The original list 2 is : [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]
    The original list 3 is : [4, 5, 4, 3, 6, 7, 8]
    List with Most unique values : [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    

**Method #2 : Usingmax() + set() \+ key**  
This task can also be performed using combination of above functions. In this,
we extract the maximum frequency list using max() and key argument len.
