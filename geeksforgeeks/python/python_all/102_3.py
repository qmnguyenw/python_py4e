Python program for multiplication and division of complex number



Given two complex numbers. The task is to multiply and divide them.

 **Multiplication of complex number:** In Python complex numbers can be
multiplied using * operator

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input:** 2+3i, 4+5i 
    **Output:** Multiplication is : (-7+22j) 
    
    **Input:** 2+3i, 1+2i
    **Output:** Multiplication is : (-4+7j)

 **Output:**

    
    
    Multiplication is : (-7+22j)
    

**Division of complex number:** In Python, complex numbers can be divided
using the / operator.

  

  

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input:** 2+3i, 4+5i
    **Output:** Division  is : (0.5609756097560976+0.0487804878048781j)
    
    **Input:** 2+3i, 1+2i
    **Output:** Division is :(1.6-0.2j)
