Python Program for Triangular Matchstick Number



Given a number X which represents the floor of a matchstick pyramid, write a
program to print the total number of matchstick required to form a pyramid of
matchsticks of x floors.

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input :** X = 1
    **Output :** 3
    **Input :** X = 2
    **Output :** 9
    

This is mainly an extension of triangular numbers. For a number X, the
matchstick required will be three times of X-th triangular numbers, i.e.,
(3*X*(X+1))/2
