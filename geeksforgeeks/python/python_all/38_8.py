Python â€“ Check if any list element is present in Tuple



Given a tuple, check if any list element is present in it.

>  **Input** : test_tup = (4, 5, 10, 9, 3), check_list = [6, 7, 10, 11]  
>  **Output** : True  
>  **Explanation** : 10 occurs in both tuple and list.
>
>  **Input** : test_tup = (4, 5, 12, 9, 3), check_list = [6, 7, 10, 11]  
>  **Output** : False  
>  **Explanation** : No common elements.

 **Method #1 : Using loop**

In this, we keep a boolen variable, keeping record of all elements, if found,
then returns True, else False.

test_tup = (4, 5, 7, 9, 3)

 

# printing original tuple

print("The original tuple is : " + str(test_tup))

 

# initializing list 

check_list = [6, 7, 10, 11]

 

res = False

for ele in check_list:

 

 # checking using in operator

 if ele in test_tup :

 res = True

 break

 

# printing result 

print("Is any list element present in tuple ? : " + str(res))

**Output**

    
    
    The original tuple is : (4, 5, 7, 9, 3)
    Is any list element present in tuple ? : True
    

**Method #2 : Using any()**

This returns True, if any element of list is found in tuple, test using in
operator.
