Python | Extract numbers from list of strings



Sometimes, we can data in many forms and we desire to perform both conversions
and extractions of certain specific parts of a whole. One such issue can be
extracting a number from a string and extending this, sometimes it can be more
than just an element string but a list of it. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in
which this can be solved.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +split()**

This particular problem can be solved using the list comprehension function to
extend the logic to all the items and split function performs the task of
splitting and to fetch the target desired element.

# Extracting numbers from list of strings

# using list comprehension + split()

 

# initializing list

test_list = ['Rs. 24', 'Rs. 18', 'Rs. 8', 'Rs. 21']

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension + split()

# Extracting numbers from list of strings

res = [int(sub.split('.')[1]) for sub in test_list]

 

# print result

print("The list after Extracting numbers : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : ['Rs. 24', 'Rs. 18', 'Rs. 8', 'Rs. 21']
    The list after Extracting numbers : [24, 18, 8, 21]
    

  

  

**Method #2 : Usingjoin() + isnumeric() \+ list comprehension + map()**

This method is preferred in the instances in which it is not predefined that
the numbers will be ordered in a particular way i.e, this method gives the
flexibility of getting the number from whichever position possible.
