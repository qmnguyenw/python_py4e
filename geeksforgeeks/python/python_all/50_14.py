Python â€“ Remove Tuples of Length K



Given list of tuples, remove all the tuples with length K.

>  **Input** : test_list = [(4, 5), (4, ), (8, 6, 7), (1, ), (3, 4, 6, 7)], K
> = 2  
>  **Output** : [(4, ), (8, 6, 7), (1, ), (3, 4, 6, 7)]  
>  **Explanation** : (4, 5) of len = 2 is removed.
>
>  **Input** : test_list = [(4, 5), (4, ), (8, 6, 7), (1, ), (3, 4, 6, 7)], K
> = 3  
>  **Output** : [(4, 5), (4, ), (1, ), (3, 4, 6, 7)]  
>  **Explanation** : 3 length tuple is removed.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension**

This is one of the ways in which this task can be performed. In this, we
iterate for all elements in loop and perform the required task of removal of K
length elements using conditions.

# Using list comprehension

 

# initializing list

test_list = [(4, 5), (4, ), (8, 6, 7), (1, ),
(3, 4, 6, 7)]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing K 

K = 1

 

# 1 liner to perform task

# filter just lengths other than K 

# len() used to compute length

res = [ele for ele in test_list if len(ele) != K]

 

# printing result 

print("Filtered list : " + str(res))

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list : [(4, 5), (4, ), (8, 6, 7), (1, ), (3, 4, 6, 7)]
    Filtered list : [(4, 5), (8, 6, 7), (3, 4, 6, 7)]
    
    

**Method #2 : Using filter() + lambda + len()**

Yet another way to solve this problem. In this, we perform filtering using
filter() and lambda function to extract just non K length elements using
len().

K = 1

 

# filter() filters non K length values and returns result

res = list(filter(lambda x : len(x) != K, test_list))
