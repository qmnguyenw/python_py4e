Python Program for focal length of a spherical mirror



Focal length is the distance between the center of the mirror to the principal
foci. In order to determine the focal length of a spherical mirror we should
know the radius of curvature of that mirror. The distance from the vertex to
the center of curvature is called radius of curvature.

The focal length is half the radius of curvature.  
 **Formula :**

    
    
    F =   ( R / 2 )      for concave mirror
    F = - ( R / 2 )      for convex mirror

Examples :

    
    
    For a convex mirror
    Input : R = 30 
    Output : F = 15
    
    
    For a convex mirror
    Input : R = 25
    Output : F = - 12.5
