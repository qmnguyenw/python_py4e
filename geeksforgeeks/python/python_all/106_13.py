Python | Remove Initial K column elements



Sometimes, while working with Matrix data, we can have stray elements that
attached at front end of each row of matrix. This can be undesired at times
and wished to be removed. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this task can be
performed.

 **Method #1 : Using loop +del \+ list slicing**  
The combination of above functionalities can be used to perform this task. In
this, we run a loop for each row in matrix and remove the front elements using
del.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Remove Initial K column elements

# Using loop + del + list slicing

 

# initialize list

test_list = [[1, 3, 4], [2, 4, 6], [3, 8,
1]]

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# initialize K 

K = 2

 

# Remove Initial K column elements

# Using loop + del + list slicing

for sub in test_list: del sub[:K]

 

# printing result

print("Matrix after removal of front elements from rows : " +
str(test_list))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [[1, 3, 4], [2, 4, 6], [3, 8, 1]]
    Matrix after removal of front elements from rows : [[4], [6], [1]]
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension + list slicing**  
The combination of above functions can also be used to perform this task. In
this, we just iterate for each row and delete front elements using list
slicing.
