Python | Intersection in Tuple Records Data



Sometimes, while working with data, we may have a problem in which we require
to find the matching records between two lists that we receive. This is a very
common problem and records usually occur as a tuple. Letâ€™s discuss certain
ways in which this problem can be solved.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension**  
List comprehension can opt as method to perform this task in one line rather
than running a loop to find the common element. In this, we just iterate for
single list and check if any element occurs in other one.

# Using list comprehension

 

# Initializing lists

test_list1 = [('gfg', 1), ('is', 2), ('best',
3)]

test_list2 = [('i', 3), ('love', 4), ('gfg', 1)]

 

# printing original lists

print("The original list 1 is : " + str(test_list1))

print("The original list 2 is : " + str(test_list2))

 

# Intersection in Tuple Records Data

# Using list comprehension

res = [ele1 for ele1 in test_list1 

 for ele2 in test_list2 if ele1 == ele2]

 

# printing result

print("The Intersection of data records is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list 1 is : [('gfg', 1), ('is', 2), ('best', 3)]
    The original list 2 is : [('i', 3), ('love', 4), ('gfg', 1)]
    The Intersection of data records is : [('gfg', 1)]
    

**Method #2 : Usingset.intersection()**  
This task can also be performed in smaller way using the generic set
intersection. In this, we first convert the list of records to a set and then
perform its intersection using intersection().

    The original list 2 is : [('i', 3), ('love', 4), ('gfg', 1)]
    The Intersection of data records is : [('gfg', 1)]
