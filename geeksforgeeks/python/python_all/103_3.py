Python | Substring removal in String list



While working with strings, one of the most used application is removing the
part of string with another. Since string in itself is immutable, the
knowledge of this utility in itself is quite useful. Here the removing of a
substring in list of string is performed. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which
this can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +replace()**  
The replace method can be coupled with the list comprehension technique to
achieve this particular task. List comprehension performs the task of
iterating through the list and replace method replaces the section of
substring with empty string.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Substring removal in String list

# using list comprehension + replace()

 

# initializing list 

test_list = ['4', 'kg', 'butter', 'for', '40',
'bucks']

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list ))

 

# using list comprehension + replace()

# Substring removal in String list

res = [sub.replace('4', '') for sub in test_list]

 

# print result

print("The list after substring removal : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : ['4', 'kg', 'butter', 'for', '40', 'bucks']
    The list after substring removal : ['', 'kg', 'butter', 'for', '0', 'bucks']
    

**Method #2 : Usingmap() + lambda + replace()**  
The combination of these functions can also be used to perform this particular
task. The map and lambda help to perform the task same as list comprehension
and replace method is used to perform the remove functionality. But this
method is poor when it comes to performance than method above.
