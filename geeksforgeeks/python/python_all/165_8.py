Python | Dividing two lists



Sometimes we come across the situations in which we require to apply a
particular function to each elements of two lists at similar index. Most
popular of them are 4 of the elementary mathematics operations. These are
quite similar and come up as application for certain utilities. Letâ€™s discuss
certain ways in which the division of two lists can be performed.  

 **Method #1 : Usingzip() \+ list comprehension**  
The zip operation can be used to link one list with the other and the
computation part can be handled by the list comprehension and hence providing
a shorthand to this particular problem.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# division of lists

# using zip() + list comprehension

 

# initializing lists 

test_list1 = [3, 5, 2, 6, 4]

test_list2 = [7, 3, 4, 1, 5]

 

# printing original lists 

print ("The original list 1 is : " + str(test_list1))

print ("The original list 2 is : " + str(test_list2))

 

# division of lists

# using zip() + list comprehension

res = [i / j for i, j in zip(test_list1, test_list2)]

 

# printing result

print ("The division list is : " + str(res))

 **Output:**

    
    
    The original list 1 is : [3, 5, 2, 6, 4]
    The original list 2 is : [7, 3, 4, 1, 5]
    The division list is : [0.42857142857142855, 1.6666666666666667, 0.5, 6.0, 0.8]
    

  
**Method #2 : Usingmap()**  
Using map function is most elegant way in which we can possibly perform the
twining of a function with both the lists. Different operations other than
division can also be applied over it.
