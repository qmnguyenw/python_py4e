Python program to find the highest 3 values in a dictionary



Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store
data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single
value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair.

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input :** my_dict = {'A': 67, 'B': 23, 'C': 45,
                       'D': 56, 'E': 12, 'F': 69} 
    
    **Output :** {'F': 69, 'A': 67, 'D': 56}
    

Letâ€™s see differnet methods we can find the highest 3 values in a dictionary.  
  
**Method #1:** Using collections.Counter()

A **Counter** is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects. It is an
unordered collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and their
counts are stored as dictionary values. Counts are allowed to be any integer
value including zero or negative counts. The Counter class is similar to bags
or multisets in other languages.

most_common([n]) returns a list of the _n_ most common elements and their
counts from the most common to the least.

# Finding 3 highest values

high = k.most_common(3) 

 

print("Initial Dictionary:")

print(my_dict, "\n")

 

 

print("Dictionary with 3 highest values:")

print("Keys: Values")

 

for i in high:

 print(i[0]," :",i[1]," ")

 **Output:**

    
    
    Initial Dictionary:
    {'C': 45, 'B': 23, 'D': 56, 'A': 67, 'E': 12, 'F': 69} 
    
    Dictionary with 3 highest values:
    Keys: Values
    F  : 69  
    A  : 67  
    D  : 56
    

  
**Method #2:** Using heapq.nlargest()
