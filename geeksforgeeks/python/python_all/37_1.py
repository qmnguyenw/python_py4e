Python â€“ Convert Binary tuple to Integer



Given Binary Tuple representing binary representation of number, convert to
integer.

>  **Input** : test_tup = (1, 1, 0)  
>  **Output** : 6  
>  **Explanation** : 4 + 2 = 6.
>
>  **Input** : test_tup = (1, 1, 1)  
>  **Output** : 7  
>  **Explanation** : 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.

 **Method #1 : Using join() + list comprehension + int()**

In this, we concatenate the binary tuples in string format using join() and
str(), then convert to integer by mentioning base as 2.

# initializing tuple

test_tup = (1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1)

 

# printing original tuple

print("The original tuple is : " + str(test_tup))

 

# using int() with base to get actual number

res = int("".join(str(ele) for ele in test_tup), 2) 

 

# printing result 

print("Decimal number is : " + str(res))

**Output**

    
    
    The original tuple is : (1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1)
    Decimal number is : 105
    

**Method #2 : Using bit shift and | operator**

In this we perform left bit shift and use or operator to get binary addition
and hence compute the result.
