Python | Text Summarizer



Today various organizations, be it online shopping, government and private
sector organizations, catering and tourism industry or other institutions that
offer customer services are concerned about their customers and ask for
feedback every single time we use their services. Consider the fact, that
these companies may be receiving enormous amounts of user feedback every
single day. And it would become quite tedious for the management to sit and
analyze each of those.  
But, the technologies today have reached to an extent where they can do all
the tasks of human beings. And the field which makes these things happen is
Machine Learning. The machines have become capable of understanding human
languages using Natural Language Processing. Today researches are being done
in the field of text analytics.  
And one such application of text analytics and NLP is a **Feedback
Summarizer** which helps in summarizing and shortening the text in the user
feedback. This can be done an algorithm to reduce bodies of text but keeping
its original meaning, or giving a great insight into the original text.

If you’re interested in Data Analytics, you will find learning about Natural
Language Processing very useful. Python provides immense library support for
NLP. We will be using **NLTK – the Natural Language Toolkit.** which will
serve our purpose right.

Install NLTK module on your system using :  
sudo pip install nltk

Let’s understand the steps –  
 **Step 1:** Importing required libraries
