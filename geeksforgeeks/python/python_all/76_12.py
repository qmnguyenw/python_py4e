Python â€“ Check whether a string starts and ends with the same character or not
(using Regular Expression)



Given a string. The task is to write a regular expression to check whether a
string starts and ends with the same character.

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input :**  
    abba
    **Output :**  
    Valid
    
    **Input :**  
    a
    **Output :**  
    Valid
    
    **Input :**  
    abc
    **Output :**  
    Invalid
    

**Solution:**  
The input can be divide into 2 cases:

  *  **Single character string:** All single character strings satisfies the condition that they start and end with the same character. The regex for a string with only 1 character will be-
    
        '^[a-z]$'

  *  **Multiple character string:** Here we need to check whether the first and the last character is same or not. We do this using \1. The regex will be-
    
        '^([a-z]).*\1$'

The two regular expressions can be combined using |

    
    
    '^[a-z]$|^([a-z]).*\1$'

In this program, we will use search() method of re module.

  

  

Below is the implementation.

# function for checking the string

def check(string):

 

 # pass the regualar expression 

 # and the string in the search() method 

 if(re.search(regex, string)): 

 print("Valid") 

 else: 

 print("Invalid") 

 

if __name__ == '__main__' :

 

 sample1 = "abba"

 sample2 = "a"

 sample3 = "abcd"

 

 check(sample1)

 check(sample2)

 check(sample3)
