Python | Checking if starting digits are similar in list



Sometimes we may face a problem in which we need to find for a list if it
contains numbers with the same digits. This particular utility has an
application in day-day programming. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this
task can be achieved.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +map()**  
We can approach this problem by converting the elements to the strings and
then testing the starting element of string and if they are equal we can
return true and then convert to set and test for size of result to be one. The
conversion is done by map, set function converts to set and list comprehension
checks for first element of string.

# checking for first digit in elements

# using list comprehension + map()

 

# initializing list 

test_list = [45, 4, 428829, 432]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension + map()

# checking for first digit in elements

res = len(set(sub[0] for sub in map(str,
test_list))) == 1

 

# print result

print("Does each element start with same digit ? " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [45, 4, 428829, 432]
    Does each element start with same digit ? True
    

**Method #2 : Usingall() \+ list comprehension**  
This is yet another approach in which this problem can be solved. In this we
use all function to check for all elements and return a Boolean result and
list comprehension does the part of conversion of string by str function and
checking for all elements with the first digit of first element.

for i in test_list)
