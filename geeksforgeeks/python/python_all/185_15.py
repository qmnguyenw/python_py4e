# Python program for implementation of Insertion Sort

 

# Function to do insertion sort

def insertionSort(arr):

 

 # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)

 for i in range(1, len(arr)):

 

 key = arr[i]

 

 # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are

 # greater than key, to one position ahead

 # of their current position

 j = i-1

 while j >=0 and key < arr[j] :

 arr[j+1] = arr[j]

 j -= 1

 arr[j+1] = key

 

 

# Driver code to test above

arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]

insertionSort(arr)

print ("Sorted array is:")

for i in range(len(arr)):

 print ("%d" %arr[i])
