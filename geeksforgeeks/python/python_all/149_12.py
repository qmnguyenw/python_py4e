Python | Grouped summation of tuple list



Many times, we are given a list of tuples and we need to group its keys and
perform certain operation while grouping. The most common operation being
addition. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this task can be performed.
Apart from addition other operations can also be performed by doing small
changes.

 **Method : UsingCounter() \+ "+" operator**

This task can be performed using the Counter function as it internally groups
and addition operator can be used to specify the functionality on the grouped
result.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# group summation of tuple list 

# using Counter() + "+" operator

from collections import Counter

 

# initializing list of tuples

test_list1 = [('key1', 4), ('key3', 6), ('key2',
8)]

test_list2 = [('key2', 1), ('key1', 4), ('key3',
2)]

 

# printing original lists

print("The original list 1 : " + str(test_list1))

print("The original list 2 : " + str(test_list2))

 

# using Counter() + "+" operator

# group summation of tuple list 

cumul_1 = Counter(dict(test_list1))

cumul_2 = Counter(dict(test_list2))

cumul_3 = cumul_1 + cumul_2 

res = list(cumul_3.items())

 

# print result

print("The grouped summation tuple list is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list 1 : [('key1', 4), ('key3', 6), ('key2', 8)]
    The original list 2 : [('key2', 1), ('key1', 4), ('key3', 2)]
    The grouped summation tuple list is : [('key2', 9), ('key1', 8), ('key3', 8)]
