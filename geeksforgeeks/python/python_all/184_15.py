Python Program to Count trailing zeroes in factorial of a number



Given an integer n, write a function that returns count of trailing zeroes in
n!.

 **Examples :**

    
    
    Input: n = 5
    Output: 1 
    Factorial of 5 is 120 which has one trailing 0.
    
    Input: n = 20
    Output: 4
    Factorial of 20 is 2432902008176640000 which has
    4 trailing zeroes.
    
    Input: n = 100
    Output: 24
    
    
    
    Trailing 0s in n! = Count of 5s in prime factors of n!
                      = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ....
