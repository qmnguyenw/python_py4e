Python | Sectional subset sum in list



Some of the classical problems in programming domain comes from different
categories and one among them is finding the sum of subsets. This particular
problem is also common when we need to accumulate the sum and store
consecutive group summation. Letâ€™s try different approaches to this problem in
python language.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +sum()**  
The list comprehension can be used to perform the this particular task to
filter out successive groups and sum function can be used to get the summation
of the filtered solution.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Sectional subset sum in list 

# using list comprehension + sum()

 

# initializing list

test_list = [4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 13, 17,
14]

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension + sum()

# Sectional subset sum in list 

res = [ sum(test_list[x : x + 3]) 

 for x in range(0, len(test_list), 3)]

 

# printing result

print("The grouped summation list is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 13, 17, 14]
    The grouped summation list is : [19, 37, 44]
    

**Method #2 : Usingsum() + itertools.islice()**  
The task of slicing the list into chunks is done by islice method here and the
conventional task of getting the summation is done by the sum function as the
above method.
