Python | Operation to each element in list



Given a list, we always come across situations in which we require to apply
certain function to each element in a list. This can be easily done by
applying a loop and performing an operation to each element. But having
shorthands to solve this problem is always beneficial and helps to focus more
on important aspects of problem. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which each
element of list can be operated.  

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension**  
This method performs the same task in the background as done by the looping
constructs. The advantage this particular method provides is that this is a
one liner and also improves code readability.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# operations on each list element

# using list comprehension

 

# initializing list 

test_list = ["geeks", "for", "geeks", "is", "best"]

 

# printing original list

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# operations on each list element

# using list comprehension

# uppercasing each element

res = [i.upper() for i in test_list]

 

# printing result

print ("The uppercased list is : " + str(res))  
  
---

 **Output:**

    
    
    The original list is : ['geeks', 'for', 'geeks', 'is', 'best']
    The uppercased list is : ['GEEKS', 'FOR', 'GEEKS', 'IS', 'BEST']
    

  
**Method #2 : Usingmap()**  
Using map function, one can easily associate an element with the operation one
wishes to perform. This is the most elegant way to perform or solve this kind
of problems.

# initializing list 

test_list = ["Geeks", "foR", "gEEks", "IS", "bEST"]

 

# printing original list

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# operations on each list element

# using map()

# lowercasing each element

res = list(map(str.lower, test_list))

 

# printing result

print ("The lowercased list is : " + str(res))  
  
---  
  
 __

 **Output:**

    
    
    The original list is : ['Geeks', 'foR', 'gEEks', 'IS', 'bEST']
    The uppercased list is : ['geeks', 'for', 'geeks', 'is', 'best']
