Python | Repeating tuples N times



Sometimes, while working with data, we might have a problem in which we need
to replicate, i.e construct duplicates of tuples. This is important
application in many domains of computer programming. Letâ€™s discuss certain
ways in which this task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using* operator**  
The multiplication operator can be used to construct the duplicates of a
container. This also can be extended to tuples even though tuples are
immutable.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Repeating tuples N times

# using * operator

 

# initialize tuple 

test_tup = (1, 3)

 

# printing original tuple 

print("The original tuple : " + str(test_tup))

 

# initialize N 

N = 4

 

# Repeating tuples N times

# using * operator

res = ((test_tup, ) * N)

 

# printing result

print("The duplicated tuple elements are : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original tuple : (1, 3)
    The duplicated tuple elements are : ((1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3))
    

**Method #2 : Using repeat()**  
The internal function of itertools library, repeat() can be used to achieve
the solution to the above problem.

test_tup = (1, 3)

print("The original tuple : " + str(test_tup))

 

# initialize N 

N = 4

 

# Repeating tuples N times

# using repeat()

res = tuple(repeat(test_tup, N))

 

# printing result

print("The duplicated tuple elements are : " + str(res))

    The original tuple : (1, 3)
    The duplicated tuple elements are : ((1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3))
