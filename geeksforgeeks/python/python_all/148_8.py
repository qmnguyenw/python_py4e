Python | Dictionary with index as value



The interconversion between the datatypes is very popular and hence many
articles have been written to demonstrate different kind of problems with
their solutions. This article deals with yet another similar type problem of
converting a list to dictionary, with values as the index where element
occurs. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this problem can be solved.

 **Method #1 : Using dictionary comprehension +enumerate()**

This problem can be solved easily using the combination of above functions,
dictionary comprehension can perform the task of constructing the dictionary
and enumerate function can be used to access the index value along with the
element.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Dictionary with index as value

# using Dictionary comprehension + enumerate()

 

# initializing list

test_list = ['Nikhil', 'Akshat', 'Akash', 'Manjeet']

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using Dictionary comprehension + enumerate()

# Dictionary with index as value

res = {val : idx + 1 for idx, val in enumerate(test_list)}

 

# print result

print("The Dictionary after index keys : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : ['Nikhil', 'Akshat', 'Akash', 'Manjeet']
    The Dictionary after index keys : {'Akshat': 2, 'Nikhil': 1, 'Manjeet': 4, 'Akash': 3}
    

  

  

**Method #2 : Usingdict() + zip()**

This problem can also be solved using the combination of above 2 functions,
the dict method can be used to convert to dictionary and zip function can be
used to map the indices with the keys.
