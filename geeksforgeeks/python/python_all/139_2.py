Python | Lowercase first character of String



The problem of capitalizing a string is quite common and has been discussed
many times. But sometimes, we might have a problem like this in which we need
to convert the first character of string to lowercase. Letâ€™s discuss certain
ways in which this can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using string slicing +lower()**  
This task can easily be performed using the lower method which lowercases the
characters provided to it and slicing can be used to add the remaining string
after the lowercase first character.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Lowercase first character of String

# Using lower() + string slicing

 

# initializing string 

test_str = "GeeksforGeeks"

 

# printing original string 

print("The original string is : " + str(test_str))

 

# Using lower() + string slicing

# Lowercase first character of String

res = test_str[0].lower() + test_str[1:]

 

# printing result 

print("The string after lowercasing initial character : " +
str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original string is : GeeksforGeeks
    The string after lowercasing initial character : geeksforGeeks
    

**Method #2 : Using lambda + string slicing +lower()**  
The recipe of lambda function has to be added if we need to perform the task
of handling None values or empty strings as well, and this becomes essential
to handle edge cases.
