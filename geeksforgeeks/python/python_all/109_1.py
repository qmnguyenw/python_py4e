Python | i^k Summation in list



Python being the language of magicians can be used to perform many tedious and
repetitive tasks in a easy and concise manner and having the knowledge to
utilize this tool to the fullest is always useful. One such small application
can be finding sum of i^k of list in just one line. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways
in which this can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Usingreduce() \+ lambda + pow()**  
The power of lambda functions to perform lengthy tasks in just one line,
allows it combined with reduce which is used to accumulate the subproblem, to
perform this task as well. The pow() is used to perform task of computing
power. Works with only Python 2.

# Python code to demonstrate

# i ^ k Summation in list

# using reduce() + lambda + pow()

 

# initializing list

test_list = [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]

 

# printing original list 

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing K 

K = 4

 

# using reduce() + lambda + pow()

# i ^ k Summation in list

res = reduce(lambda i, j: i + pow(j, K),
[pow(test_list[:1][0], K)] + test_list[1:])

 

# printing result

print ("The sum of i ^ k of list is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
    The sum of i^k of list is : 24309
    

**Method #2 : Usingmap() + sum() + pow()**  
The similar solution can also be obtained using the map function to integrate
and sum function to perform the summation of the i^k number.
