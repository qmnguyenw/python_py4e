Python Program for Comb Sort



Comb Sort is mainly an improvement over Bubble Sort. Bubble sort always
compares adjacent values. So all inversions are removed one by one. Comb Sort
improves on Bubble Sort by using gap of size more than 1. The gap starts with
a large value and shrinks by a factor of 1.3 in every iteration until it
reaches the value 1. Thus Comb Sort removes more than one inversion counts
with one swap and performs better than Bublle Sort.

The shrink factor has been empirically found to be 1.3 (by testing Combsort on
over 200,000 random lists) [Source: Wiki]

Although, it works better than Bubble Sort on average, worst case remains
O(n2).
