Python â€“ Test for strictly decreasing list



The test for monotonic sequence is a utility that has manifold applications in
mathematics and hence every sphere related to mathematics. As mathematics and
Computer Science generally go parallel, mathematical operations such as
checking for strictly decreasing sequence can be useful to gather knowledge
of. Lets discuss certain ways to perform this test.

 **Method #1 : Usingall() + zip()**  
The all() generally checks for all the elements fed to it. The task of zip()
is to link list beginning from beginning and list beginning from first
element, so that a check can be performed on all elements.

# Python 3 code to demonstrate

# Test for strictly decreasing list

# using zip() + all()

 

# initializing list

test_list = [10, 8, 7, 5, 4, 1]

 

# printing original lists

print ("Original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using zip() + all()

# Test for strictly decreasing list

res = all(i > j for i, j in zip(test_list,
test_list[1:]))

 

# printing result

print ("Is list strictly decreasing ? : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    Original list : [10, 8, 7, 5, 4, 1]
    Is list strictly decreasing ? : True
    

**Method #2 : Usingreduce() \+ lambda**  
reduce() coupled with lambda can also perform this task of checking for
monotonicity. reduce function is used to cumulate the result as True or False,
lambda function checks for each index value with next index value.
