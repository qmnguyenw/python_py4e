Python | Column summation in uneven sized lists



The usual list of list, unlike conventional C type Matrix, can allow the
nested list of lists with variable lengths, and when we require the summation
of its columns, the uneven length of rows may lead to some elements in that
element to be absent and if not handled correctly, may throw exception. Letâ€™s
discuss certain ways in which this problem can be performed in error-free
manner.

 **Method #1 : Usingsum() + filter() + map() \+ list comprehension**  
The combination of above three function combined with list comprehension can
help us perform this particular task, the sum function helps to perform the
summation, filter allows us to check for the present elements and all rows are
combined using the map function. Works only with python 2

# Column summation in uneven sized lists

# using sum() + filter() + map() + list comprehension

 

# initializing list of lists

test_list = [[1, 5, 3], [4], [9, 8]]

 

# printing original list 

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# using sum() + filter() + map() + list comprehension

# Column summation in uneven sized lists

res = [sum(filter(None, j)) for j in map(None,
*test_list)]

 

# printing result

print ("The summation of columns is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [[1, 5, 3], [4], [9, 8]]
    The summation of columns is : [14, 13, 3]
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension +sum() + zip_longest()**  
If one desires not to play with the None values, one can opt for this method
to resolve this particular problem. The zip_longest function helps to fill the
not present column with 0 so that it does not has to handle the void of
elements not present.
