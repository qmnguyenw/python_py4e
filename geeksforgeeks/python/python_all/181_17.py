Python Program for Largest K digit number divisible by X



Integers X and K are given. The task is to find highest K-digit number
divisible by X.

 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input :** X = 30, K = 3
    **Output :** 990
    990 is the largest three digit 
    number divisible by 30.
    
    **Input :** X = 7, K = 2
    **Output :** 98
    

An **efficient solution** is to use below formula.

    
    
    ans = MAX - (MAX % X)
    where MAX is the largest K digit 
    number which is  999...K-times

The formula works on simple school method division. We remove remainder to get
the largest divisible number.
