Python Program for Heap Sort



Heapsort is a comparison based sorting technique based on a Binary Heap data
structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum
element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process
for the remaining element.

# Python program for implementation of heap Sort

 

# To heapify subtree rooted at index i.

# n is size of heap

def heapify(arr, n, i):

 largest = i # Initialize largest as root

 l = 2 * i + 1 # left = 2*i + 1

 r = 2 * i + 2 # right = 2*i + 2

 

 # See if left child of root exists and is

 # greater than root

 if l < n and arr[i] < arr[l]:

 largest = l

 

 # See if right child of root exists and is

 # greater than root

 if r < n and arr[largest] < arr[r]:

 largest = r

 

 # Change root, if needed

 if largest != i:

 arr[i],arr[largest] = arr[largest],arr[i] # swap

 

 # Heapify the root.

 heapify(arr, n, largest)

 

# The main function to sort an array of given size

def heapSort(arr):

 n = len(arr)

 

 # Build a maxheap.

 # Since last parent will be at ((n//2)-1) we can start at that location.

 for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):

 heapify(arr, n, i)

 

 # One by one extract elements

 for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):

 arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i] # swap

 heapify(arr, i, 0)

 

# Driver code to test above

arr = [ 12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
