Python program to find the gcd of two numbers



Given two numbers. The task is to find the GCD of the two numbers.

 **Using STL :**

In Python, the math module contains a number of mathematical operations, which
can be performed with ease using the module. math.gcd() function compute the
greatest common divisor of 2 numbers mentioned in its arguments.

>  **Syntax:** math.gcd(x, y)
>
>  **Parameter:**
>
>  
>
>
>  
>
>
>  **x** : Non-negative integer whose gcd has to be computed.
>
>  **y** : Non-negative integer whose gcd has to be computed.
>
>  **Returns:** An absolute/positive integer value after calculating the GCD
> of given parameters x and y.
>
>  **Exceptions:** When Both x and y are 0, function returns 0, If any number
> is a character, Type error is raised.

**Using Euclidean Algorithm :**

The Euclidâ€™s algorithm (or Euclidean Algorithm) is a method for efficiently
finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The GCD of two
integers X and Y is the largest number that divides both of X and Y (without
leaving a remainder).

Pseudo Code of the Algorithm-

  1. Let a, b be the two numbers
  2. a mod b = R
  3. Let a = b and b = R
  4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until a mod b is greater than 0
  5. GCD = b
  6. Finish
