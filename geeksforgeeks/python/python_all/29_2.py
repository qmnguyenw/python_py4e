Python â€“ Filter Tuples Product greater than K



Given a Tuple list, extract all with product greater than K.

>  **Input** : test_list = [(4, 5, 7), (1, 2, 3), (8, 4, 2), (2, 3, 4)], K =
> 50  
> **Output** : [(4, 5, 7), (8, 4, 2)]  
> **Explanation** : 140 and 64 are greater than 50, hence tuples extracted.
>
>  **Input** : test_list = [(4, 5, 7), (1, 2, 3), (8, 4, 2), (2, 3, 4)], K =
> 100  
> **Output** : [(4, 5, 7)]  
> **Explanation** : 140 is greater than 100, hence tuple extracted.

**Method #1 : Using list comprehension**

In this, we extract all the tuples, greater than K product using external
function.

# initializing list

test_list = [(4, 5, 7), (1, 2, 3), (8, 4,
2), (2, 3, 4)]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing K

K = 50

 

res = [sub for sub in test_list if prod(sub) > K]

 

# printing result

print("Tuples with product greater than K : " + str(res))

 **Output:**

> The original list is : [(4, 5, 7), (1, 2, 3), (8, 4, 2), (2, 3, 4)]  
> Tuples with product greater than K : [(4, 5, 7), (8, 4, 2)]

 **Method #2 : Using filter() + lambda**

In this, task of filtering tuples is done using _filter()_ and _lambda_ ,
product is computed in similar way.

 **Output:**

> Tuples with product greater than K : [(4, 5, 7), (8, 4, 2)]
