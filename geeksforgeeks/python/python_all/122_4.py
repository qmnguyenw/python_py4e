Python | All possible N combination tuples



Sometimes, while working with Python tuples, we might have a problem in which
we need to generate all possible combination pairs till N. This can have
application in mathematics domain. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this
problem can be solved.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +product()**  
This task can be performed using list comprehension which can be used to
iterate the container of N numbers and product() performs the task of
formation of combinations from them.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# All possible N combination tuples

# Using list comprehesion + product()

from itertools import product

 

# initialize N 

N = 3

 

# All possible N combination tuples

# Using list comprehesion + product()

res = [ele for ele in product(range(1, N + 1),
repeat = N)]

 

# printing result

print("Tuple Combinations till N are : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

> Tuple Combinations till N are : [(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 3), (1, 2, 1),
> (1, 2, 2), (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 1), (1, 3, 2), (1, 3, 3), (2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 2),
> (2, 1, 3), (2, 2, 1), (2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 3), (2, 3, 1), (2, 3, 2), (2, 3, 3),
> (3, 1, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 1, 3), (3, 2, 1), (3, 2, 2), (3, 2, 3), (3, 3, 1),
> (3, 3, 2), (3, 3, 3)]

  

  

**Method #2 : Usingproduct()**  
This task can also be performed by using just the single function. The use of
list comprehension can be eliminated using the conversion to list.
