Python â€“ Elements with K lists similar index value



Sometimes, while working with data, we can have a problem in which we need to
get elements which are similar in K lists in particular index. This can have
application in many domains such as day-day and other domains. Lets discuss
certain ways in which this task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Usingzip() \+ loop**  
This is brute way in which this task can be performed. In this, we iterate the
loop in zipped list and compare with elements in particular index for
similarity.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Elements with K lists similar index value

# using zip() + loop

 

# Initializing lists

test_list1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]

test_list2 = [1, 4, 8, 9]

test_list3 = [3, 7, 5, 10]

 

# printing original lists

print("The original list 1 is : " + str(test_list1))

print("The original list 2 is : " + str(test_list2))

print("The original list 3 is : " + str(test_list3))

 

# Initializing K 

K = 2

 

# Elements with K lists similar index value

# using zip() + loop

res = []

for a, b, c in zip(test_list1, test_list2, test_list3):

 if a == b or b == c or c == a:

 if a == b:

 res.append(a)

 elif b == c:

 res.append(b)

 elif c == a:

 res.append(c)

 

# printing result 

print ("The list after checking on 2 lists : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list 1 is : [1, 3, 5, 7]
    The original list 2 is : [1, 4, 8, 9]
    The original list 3 is : [3, 7, 5, 10]
    The list after checking on 2 lists : [1, 5]
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension +set() + count()**  
The combination of above methods can also be used to perform this task. In
this, we check for count using count() and rest of functionalities are
performed using list comprehension.

res = [ele for sub in zip(test_list1, test_list2, test_list3)
for ele in set(sub) if sub.count(ele) > 1]

 

# printing result 

print ("The list after checking on 2 lists : " + str(res))
