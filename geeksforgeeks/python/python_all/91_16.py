Python | Maximum of Product Pairs in Tuple List



Sometimes, while working with data, we might have a problem in which we need
to find maximum product between available pairs in list. This can be
application to many problems in mathematics domain. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways
in which this task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Usingmax() \+ list comprehension**  
The combination of this functions can be used to perform this task. In this,
we compute the product of all pairs and then return the max of it using max().

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Maximum of Product Pairs in Tuple List

# Using list comprehension + max()

 

# initialize list

test_list = [(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1,
2)]

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# Maximum of Product Pairs in Tuple List

# Using list comprehension + max()

temp = [abs(b * a) for a, b in test_list]

res = max(temp)

 

# printing result

print("Maximum product among pairs : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]
    Maximum product among pairs : 30
    

**Method #2 : Using max() \+ lambda**  
This is similar to above method. In this the task performed by list
comprehension is solved using lambda function, providing the product
computation logic. Returns the max. product pair.

    Maximum product among pairs : 30
