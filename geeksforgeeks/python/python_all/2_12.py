Python â€“ Create nested list containing values as the count of list items



Given a list, the task is to write a Python program to create a nested list
where the values are the count of list items.

 **Examples:**

    
    
     **Input:** [1, 2, 3]
    **Output:** [[1], [2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
    
    **Input:** [4, 5]
    **Output:** [[1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]

 **Method 1: Using nested** **list comprehension**

The list will contain the count of the list items for each element e in the
list we will create a list in the list with size e, in each list we will
append the element e for e times.

l= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

l = [[i+1 for j in range(l[i])] for i in
range(len(l))]

print(l)  
  
---

 **Output:**

  

  

    
    
    [[1], [2, 2], [3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 4], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]

 **Method 2:**

The list will contain the count of the list items iterate the for loop for L
times i.e. length of the list. Now at each element append a list, The appended
list will be of the size count.

print(l)
