Python | Matrix Product



Getting the product of list is quite common problem and has been dealt with
and discussed many times, but sometimes, we require to better it and total
product, i.e. including those of nested list as well. Letâ€™s try and get the
total product and solve this particular problem.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension + loop**  
We can solve this problem using the list comprehension as a potential
shorthand to the conventional loops that we may use to perform this particular
task. We just iterate and product the nested list and at end return the
cumulative product using function.

 res *= ele

 return res 

 

# initializing list

test_list = [[1, 4, 5], [7, 3], [4], [46,
7, 3]]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension + loop

# Matrix Product

res = prod([ele for sub in test_list for ele in sub])

 

# print result

print("The total element product in lists is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [[1, 4, 5], [7, 3], [4], [46, 7, 3]]
    The total element product in lists is : 1622880
    

**Method #2 : Usingchain() \+ loop**  
This particular problem can also be solved using the chain function instead of
list comprehension in which we use the conventional function to perform
product.
