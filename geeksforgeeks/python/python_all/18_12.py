Python â€“ Extract rows with Complex data types



Given Matrix, extract rows with complex data types.

**Examples:**

>  **Input** : test_list = [[4, 2, 5], [1, [3, 4], 9], [5], [7, (2, 3), 3, 9]]  
> **Output** : [[1, [3, 4], 9], [7, (2, 3), 3, 9]]  
> **Explanation** : Rows have lists and tuples respectively.  
>
>
> **Input** : test_list = [[4, 2, [5]], [1, [3, 4], 9], [5], [7, (2, 3), 3,
> 9]]  
> **Output** : [[4, 2, [5]], [1, [3, 4], 9], [7, (2, 3), 3, 9]]  
> **Explanation** : Rows have lists and tuples respectively.

**Method #1: Using** **list comprehension** **+** **isinstance()** **+**
**any()**

  

  

In this, we check for each element of row to be of dictionary, tuple, set or
list datatype using isinstance(), if any element is found to have that
instance, the row is added in result.

# Extract rows with Complex data types

# Using list comprehension + isinstance() + any()

 

# initializing list

test_list = [[4, 2, 5], [1, [3, 4], 9],
[5], [7, (2, 3), 3, 9]]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# checking for any of list, set, tuple or

# dictionary as complex structures

res = [row for row in test_list if any(isinstance(ele,
list) or isinstance(ele, tuple)

 or isinstance(ele, dict) or isinstance(ele, set) for
ele in row)]

 

# printing result

print("Filtered Rows : " + str(res))

 **Output:**

> The original list is : [[4, 2, 5], [1, [3, 4], 9], [5], [7, (2, 3), 3, 9]]  
> Filtered Rows : [[1, [3, 4], 9], [7, (2, 3), 3, 9]]

 **Method #2 : Using** **filter()** **+** **lambda** **\+ isinstance()**

In this, we perform task of filtering using filter and lambda, checking for
data type is done using isinstance().
