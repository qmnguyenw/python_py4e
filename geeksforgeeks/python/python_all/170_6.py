Python | Get the Index of first element greater than K



Python list operations are always desired to have shorthands as they are used
in many places in development. Hence having knowledge of them always remains
quite useful.  
Letâ€™s deals with finding one such utility of having index of first element
greater than K by one-liner. There are various ways in which this can be
achieved.

 **Method #1 : Usingnext() + enumerate()**  
Using next() returns the iterator to the element that has been using the
enumerate(). We simply put the condition for enumerate and next() picks
appropriate element index.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# to find index of first element just 

# greater than K 

# using enumerate() + next()

 

# initializing list

test_list = [0.4, 0.5, 11.2, 8.4, 10.4]

 

# printing original list

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# using enumerate() + next() to find index of

# first element just greater than 0.6 

res = next(x for x, val in enumerate(test_list)

 if val > 0.6)

 

# printing result

print ("The index of element just greater than 0.6 : "

 + str(res))

 **Output:**

    
    
    The original list is : [0.4, 0.5, 11.2, 8.4, 10.4]
    The index of element just greater than 0.6 : 2
    

  
**Method #2 : Usingfilter() \+ lambda**  
Using filter along with lambda can also help us to achieve this particular
task, subscript index value 0 is used to specify that first element greater
than value has to be taken.
