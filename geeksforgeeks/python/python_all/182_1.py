Python Program for Range sum queries without updates



Given an array arr of integers of size n. We need to compute sum of elements
from index i to index j. The queries consisting of i and j index values will
be executed multiple times.

Examples:

    
    
    Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
            i = 1, j = 3
            i = 2, j = 4
    Output :  9
             12         
    
    Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
            i = 0, j = 4 
            i = 1, j = 2 
    Output : 15
              5

# Python program to find sum between two indexes

# when there is no update.

 

def find_ans(ar, j, k):

 l = len(ar)

 for i in range(1, l):

 ar[i] = ar[i] + ar[i-1]

 

 print(ar[k] - ar[j-1])

 return; 

 

 

pr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

ar = pr[:]

find_ans(ar, 1, 3)

ar = pr[:]

find_ans(ar, 2, 4)
