Python Program for simple interest



Examples:

    
    
    EXAMPLE1:
    Input : P = 10000
            R = 5
            T = 5
    Output :2500
    We need to find simple interest on 
    Rs. 10,000 at the rate of 5% for 5 
    units of time.
    
    EXAMPLE2:
    Input : P = 3000
            R = 7
            T = 1
    Output :210

# Python3 program to find simple interest

# for given principal amount, time and

# rate of interest.

 

 

def simple_interest(p,t,r):

 print('The principal is', p)

 print('The time period is', t)

 print('The rate of interest is',r)

 

 si = (p * t * r)/100

 

 print('The Simple Interest is', si)

 return si

 **Output:**

    
    
    The principal is 8
    The time period is 6
    The rate of interest is 8
    The Simple Interest is 3.84
