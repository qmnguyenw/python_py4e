Python | Mean of tuple list



Sometimes, while working with Python tuple list, we can have a problem in
which we need to find the average of tuple values in the list. This problem
has the possible application in many domains including mathematics. Letâ€™s
discuss certain ways in which this task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using loops**  
The first approach that can be thought of to solve this problem can be a brute
force approach in which we just loop each tuple to add element and then just
divide it by number of tuples in the list.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Mean of tuple list

# Using loops

 

# Initializing list

test_list = [(1, 4, 5), (7, 8), (2, 4,
10)]

 

# printing original list

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# Average of tuple list

# Using loops

sum = 0

for sub in test_list:

 for i in sub:

 sum = sum + i

res = sum / len(test_list)

 

# printing result

print("The mean of tuple list is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [(1, 4, 5), (7, 8), (2, 4, 10)]
    The mean of tuple list is : 13.666666666666666
    

**Method #2 : Usingchain() + sum()**  
In order to reduce the line of codes, the chain() functionality can be used
so that all the elements can be extracted and then can be added using sum().

# Average of tuple list

temp = list(chain(*test_list)) 

res = sum(temp)/ len(test_list)
