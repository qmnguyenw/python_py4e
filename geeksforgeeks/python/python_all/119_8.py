Python | Summation of two list of tuples



Sometimes, while working with Python records, we can have a problem in which
we need to perform cross summation of list of tuples. This kind of application
is popular in web development domain. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this
task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +zip()**  
The combination of above functionalities can be used to perform this
particular task. In this, we iterate through the list using list comprehension
and the summation across lists is performed with help of zip().

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Summation of two list of tuples

# using list comprehension + zip()

 

# initialize lists

test_list1 = [(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1)]

test_list2 = [(5, 4), (8, 10), (8, 14)]

 

# printing original lists

print("The original list 1 : " + str(test_list1))

print("The original list 2 : " + str(test_list2))

 

# Summation of two list of tuples

# using list comprehension + zip()

res = [(x[0] + y[0], x[1] + y[1]) for x, y
in zip(test_list1, test_list2)]

 

# printing result

print("The Summation across lists is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list 1 : [(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1)]
    The original list 2 : [(5, 4), (8, 10), (8, 14)]
    The Summation across lists is : [(7, 8), (14, 17), (13, 15)]
    

**Method #2 : Usingsum() + zip() + map()**  
This is yet another way to perform this task. This is similar to above method,
the difference is that summation is performed by inbuilt function and
extending logic to each element is done by map().

# Summation of two list of tuples

# using sum() + zip() + map()

res = [tuple(map(sum, zip(a, b))) for a, b in
zip(test_list1, test_list2)]

 

# printing result

print("The Summation across lists is : " + str(res))

    The original list 2 : [(5, 4), (8, 10), (8, 14)]
    The Summation across lists is : [(7, 8), (14, 17), (13, 15)]
