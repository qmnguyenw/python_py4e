Calculating Wind Chill Factor(WCF) or Wind Chill Index(WCI) in Python



 **W** ind-chill or **W** indchill is the perceived decrease in air
temperature felt by the body on exposed skin due to the flow of air. The
effect of wind chill is to increase the rate of heat loss and reduce any
warmer objects to the ambient temperature more quickly.
