Python | Records Intersection



Sometimes, while working with tuples, we can have a problem in which we need
similar features of two records. This type of application can come in Data
Science domain. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this problem can be
solved.

 **Method #1 : Usingset() + "&" operator**  
This task can be performed using symmetric difference functionality offered by
XOR operator over sets. The conversion to set is done by set().

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Records Intersection

# Using set() + "&" operator

 

# initialize tuples

test_tup1 = (3, 4, 5, 6)

test_tup2 = (5, 7, 4, 10)

 

# printing original tuples

print("The original tuple 1 : " + str(test_tup1))

print("The original tuple 2 : " + str(test_tup2))

 

# Records Intersection

# Using set() + "&" operator

res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))

 

# printing result

print("The similar elements from tuples are : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original tuple 1 : (3, 4, 5, 6)
    The original tuple 2 : (5, 7, 4, 10)
    The similar elements from tuples are : (4, 5)
    

**Method #2 : Usingintersection() + set()**  
This is method similar to above method, the difference is that instead of &
operator, we use inbuilt function to perform the task of filtering dissimilar
elements.
