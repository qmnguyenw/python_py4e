Python â€“ Summation of consecutive elements power



Given a List, the task is to write a Python program to compute summation of
power of consecutive elements occurrences frequency.

 **Examples:**

>  **Input** : test_list = [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]  
> **Output** : 110  
> **Explanation** : 2^3 + 3^4 + 4^2 + 5 = 110  
>
>
> **Input** : test_list = [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]  
> **Output** : 105  
> **Explanation** : 2^3 + 3^4 + 4^2 = 105

**Method #1 : Using loop**

  

  

In this, we iterate for each element and test for next element, if found to be
different, perform summation of power of consecutive elements, else add
counter to get frequency to raise number to.

# initializing list

test_list = [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4,
4, 5]

 

# printing original lists

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

freq = 1

res = 0

for idx in range(0, len(test_list) - 1):

 

 # adding powers

 if test_list[idx] != test_list[idx + 1]:

 res = res + test_list[idx] ** freq

 freq = 1

 else:

 freq += 1

 

# catering for last element

res = res + test_list[len(test_list) - 1] ** freq

 

# printing result

print("Computed summation of powers : " + str(res))

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list is : [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]
    Computed summation of powers : 110

 **Method #2 : Using** **defaultdict()** **\+ loop +** **sum()**

In this we capture frequency using defautldict using key value pairs and loop
is used to iterate through each element. Next, summation is performed using
sum().
