Python | Even Front digits Test in List



Sometimes we may face a problem in which we need to find for a list if it
contains numbers which are even. This particular utility has an application in
day-day programming. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this task can be
achieved.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +map()**  
We can approach this problem by converting the elements to the strings and
then testing the starting element of string and if they are even we can return
true and then convert to set and test for size of result to be one. The
conversion is done by map, set function converts to set and list comprehension
checks for first element of string.

# initializing list 

test_list = [25, 6, 828829, 432] 

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list)) 

 

# using list comprehension + map() 

# Even Front digits Test in List 

res = len(set((int(sub[0]) % 2) for sub in
map(str, test_list))) == 1

 

# print result 

print("Does each element start with even digit ? " + str(res))

**Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [25, 6, 828829, 432]
    Does each element start with even digit ? True
    

**Method #2 : Using all() \+ list comprehension**  
This is yet another approach in which this problem can be solved. In this we
use all function to check for all elements and return a Boolean result and
list comprehension does the part of conversion of string by str function and
checking for all elements with the first digit of first element to be even.
