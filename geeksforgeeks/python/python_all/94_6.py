Python â€“ Product of elements using Index list



Accessing an element from its index is easier task in python, just using the
[] operator in a list does the trick. But in certain situations we are
presented with tasks when we have more than once indices and we need to get
all the elements corresponding to those indices and then perform the
multiplication. Lets discuss certain ways to achieve this task.

 **Method #1 : Using List comprehension + loop**  
This task is easy to perform with a loop, and hence shorthand for it is the
first method to start with this task. Iterating over the index list to get the
corresponding elements from list into new list is brute method to perform this
task. The task of product is performed using loop.

# getting Product 

def prod(val) : 

 res = 1

 for ele in val: 

 res *= ele 

 return res 

 

# initializing lists 

test_list = [9, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14] 

index_list = [1, 3, 4] 

 

# printing original lists 

print ("Original list : " + str(test_list)) 

print ("Original index list : " + str(index_list)) 

 

# using list comprehension + loop to 

# Product of Index values 

res_list = prod([test_list[i] for i in index_list]) 

 

# printing result 

print ("Resultant list : " + str(res_list))   
  
---

**Output :**

    
    
    Original list : [9, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14]
    Original index list : [1, 3, 4]
    Resultant list : 320
    

**Method #2 : Usingmap() + __getitem__ \+ loop**  
Yet another method to achieve this particular task is to map one list with
other and get items of indexes and get corresponding matched elements from the
search list. This is quite quick way to perform this task. The task of product
is performed using loop.

print ("Original index list : " + str(index_list)) 

 

# using map() + __getitem__ + loop to 

# Product of Index values

res_list = prod(list(map(test_list.__getitem__, index_list))) 

 

# printing result 

print ("Resultant list : " + str(res_list))

**Output :**

    
    
    Original list : [9, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14]
    Original index list : [1, 3, 4]
    Resultant list : 320
