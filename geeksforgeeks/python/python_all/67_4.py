Python â€“ Extract hashtags from text



A **hashtag** is a keyword or phrase preceded by the hash symbol (#), written
within a post or comment to highlight it and facilitate a search for it. Some
examples are: #like, #gfg, #selfie

We are provided with a string containing hashtags, we have to extract these
hashtags into a list and print them.

 **Examples :**

    
    
    **Input :** GeeksforGeeks is a wonderful #website for #ComputerScience
    **Output :** website , ComputerScience
    
    **Input :** This day is beautiful! #instagood #photooftheday #cute
    **Output :** instagood, photooftheday, cute
    

**Method 1:**

  * Split the text into words using the split() method.
  * For every word check if the first character is a hash symbol(#) or not.
  * If yes then add the word to the list of hashtags without the hash symbol.
  * Print the list of hashtags.

 # adding the word to the hashtag_list

 hashtag_list.append(word[1:])

 

 # printing the hashtag_list

 print("The hashtags in \"" + text + "\" are :")

 for hashtag in hashtag_list:

 print(hashtag)

 text1 = "GeeksforGeeks is a wonderful # website for #
ComputerScience"

 text2 = "This day is beautiful ! # instagood # photooftheday # cute"

    The hashtags in "GeeksforGeeks is a wonderful #website for #ComputerScience" are :

    The hashtags in "This day is beautiful! #instagood #photooftheday #cute" are :

**Method 2 :** Using regular expressions.
