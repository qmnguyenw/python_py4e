median() function in Python statistics module



Python is a very popular language when it comes to data analysis and
statistics. Luckily, Python3 provide statistics module, which comes with very
useful functions like mean(), median(), mode() etc.

 **median()** function in the statistics module can be used to calculate
median value from an unsorted data-list. The biggest advantage of using
median() function is that the data-list does not need to be sorted before
being sent as parameter to the median() function.

Median is the value that separates the higher half of a data sample or
probability distribution from the lower half. For a dataset, it may be thought
of as the middle value. The median is the measure of the central tendency of
the properties of a data-set in statistics and probability theory. Median has
a very big advantage over Mean, which is the median value is not skewed so
much by extremely large or small values. The median value is either contained
in the data-set of values provided or it doesnâ€™t sway too much from the data
provided.

For _odd_ set of elements, the median value is the middle one.  
For _even_ set of elements, the median value is the mean of two middle
elements.

    
    
    Median can be represented by the following formula :
    
    ![   {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {median} \(a\)={\\frac {a_{\\lfloor \\#x\\div 2\\rfloor }+a_{\\lfloor \\#x\\div 2+0.5\\rfloor }}{2}}}  ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3f2d5f06c7ee9db8e1d00ecc8d6fd117_l3.png)

  

  

> **Syntax :** **median( _[data-set]_ )**
>
>  **Parameters :**  
>  **[data-set]** : List or tuple or an iterable with a set of numeric values
>
>  **Returns :** Return the median (middle value) of the iterable containing
> the data
>
>  **Exceptions :** **StatisticsError** is raised when iterable passed is
> empty or when list is null.

**Applications :**  
For practical applications, different measures of dispersion and population
tendency are compared on the basis of how well the corresponding population
values can be estimated. For example, a comparison shows that the sample mean
is more statistically efficient than the sample median when the data is
uncontaminated by data from heavily-tailed data distribution or from mixtures
of data distribution, but less efficient otherwise and that the efficiency of
the sample median is higher than that for a wide range of distributions. To be
more specific, the median has 64% efficiency compared to minimum-variance-mean
( for large normal samples ).
