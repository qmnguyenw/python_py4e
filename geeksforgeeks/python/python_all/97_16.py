Python | Consecutive Subsets Minimum



Some of the classical problems in programming domain comes from different
categories and one among them is finding the minimum of subsets. This
particular problem is also common when we need to accumulate the minimum and
store consecutive group minimum. Letâ€™s try different approaches to this
problem in python language.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +min()**  
The list comprehension can be used to perform the this particular task to
filter out successive groups and min function can be used to get the minimum
of the filtered solution.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Consecutive Subsets Minimum

# using list comprehension + min()

 

# initializing list

test_list = [4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 13, 17,
14]

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# using list comprehension + min()

# Consecutive Subsets Minimum

res = [ min(test_list[x : x + 3]) for x in
range(0, len(test_list), 3)]

 

# printing result

print("The grouped minimum list is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 13, 17, 14]
    The grouped minimum list is : [4, 10, 13]
    

**Method #2 : Usingmin() + itertools.islice()**  
The task of slicing the list into chunks is done by islice method here and the
conventional task of getting the minimum is done by the min function as the
above method.
