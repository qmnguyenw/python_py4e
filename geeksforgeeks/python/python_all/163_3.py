Python | Append multiple lists at once



There can be an application requirement to append elements of 2-3 lists to one
list. This kind of application has the potential to come into the domain of
Machine Learning or sometimes in web development as well. Letâ€™s discuss
certain ways in which this particular task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using + operator**  
This can be easily done using the plus operator as it does the element
addition at the back of the list. Similar logic is extended in the case of
multiple lists.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# adding multiple list at once

# using + operator

# initializing lists

test_list1 = [1, 3, 5, 5, 4]

test_list2 = [4, 6, 2, 8, 10]

test_list3 = [7, 5, 2, 9, 11]

# printing original lists

print ("The original list 1 is : " + str(test_list1))

print ("The original list 2 is : " + str(test_list2))

print ("The original list 3 is : " + str(test_list3))

# using + operator

# adding mutiple list at once

test_list1 = test_list1 + test_list2 + test_list3

 

# printing result

print ("The extended and modified list is : " + str(test_list1))  
  
---

 **Output:**

    
    
    The original list 1 is : [1, 3, 5, 5, 4]
    The original list 2 is : [4, 6, 2, 8, 10]
    The original list 3 is : [7, 5, 2, 9, 11]
    The extended and modified list is : [1, 3, 5, 5, 4, 4, 6, 2, 8, 10, 7, 5, 2, 9, 11]

  
**Method #2 : Using itertools.chain()**  
The chain function can also be employed to perform this particular tasks as it
uses the iterator to perform this and hence offers better performance over the
above method.
