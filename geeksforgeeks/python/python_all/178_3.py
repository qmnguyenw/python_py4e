Python program to convert time from 12 hour to 24 hour format



Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

 **Note :** Midnight is 12:00:00 AM on a 12-hour clock and 00:00:00 on a
24-hour clock. Noon is 12:00:00 PM on 12-hour clock and 12:00:00 on 24-hour
clock.

Examples :

    
    
    Input : 11:21:30 PM
    Output : 23:21:30
    
    Input : 12:12:20 AM
    Output : 00:12:20
    

## Recommended: Please try your approach on **__{IDE}__** first, before moving
on to the solution.

 **Approach :** Whether the time format is 12 hours or not, can be found out
by using list slicing. Check if last two elements are PM, then simply add 12
to them. If AM, then donâ€™t add. Remove AM/PM from the updated time.

 # Checking if last two elements of time

 # is AM and first two elements are 12

 if str1[-2:] == "AM" and str1[:2] == "12":

 return "00" + str1[2:-2]

 

 # remove the AM 

 elif str1[-2:] == "AM":

 return str1[:-2]

 

 # Checking if last two elements of time

 # is PM and first two elements are 12 

 elif str1[-2:] == "PM" and str1[:2] ==
"12":

 return str1[:-2]

 

 else:

 

 # add 12 to hours and remove PM

 return str(int(str1[:2]) + 12) + str1[2:8]

 

# Driver Code 

print(convert24("08:05:45 PM"))
