Python | Custom List slicing Sum



The problem of slicing a list has been dealt earlier, but sometimes we need to
perform the slicing in variable lengths and its summation according to the
input given in other list. This problem has its potential application in web
development. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this can be done.

 **Method #1 : Usingitertools.islice() + sum() \+ list comprehension**  
The list comprehension can be used to iterate through the list and the
component issue is solved using the islice function. Summation is performed by
sum().

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Custom List slicing Sum

# using itertools.islice() + sum() + list comprehension

from itertools import islice

 

# initializing test list

test_list = [1, 5, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 16,
9, 12]

 

# initializing slice list 

slice_list = [2, 1, 3, 4]

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# printing slice list 

print("The slice list : " + str(slice_list))

 

# using itertools.islice() + sum() + list comprehension

# Custom List slicing Sum

temp = iter(test_list)

res = [sum(list(islice(temp, part))) for part in
slice_list]

 

# print result

print("The variable sliced sum list is : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [1, 5, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 16, 9, 12]
    The slice list : [2, 1, 3, 4]
    The variable sliced sum list is : [6, 3, 25, 48]
    

**Method #2 : Usingzip() + accumulate() + sum() \+ list slicing**  
Apart from using the list comprehension to perform the task of binding, this
method uses zip function to hold sublist element together, accumulate function
joins the elements, and slicing is used to construct the required slicing.
Summation is performed by sum().
