Python â€“ Extract Missing Ranges



Given list of tuples, start range and end range values, extract the ranges
that are missing from the list.

>  **Input** : test_list = [(7, 2), (15, 19), (38, 50)], strt_val = 5,
> stop_val = 60  
>  **Output** : [(5, 7), (2, 60), (2, 15), (19, 60), (19, 38), (50, 60)]  
>  **Explanation** : Missing element ranges starting from 5 and ending at
> 50-60 are output as desired.
>
>  **Input** : test_list = [(7, 2), (15, 19), (38, 50)], strt_val = 1,
> stop_val = 52  
>  **Output** : [(1, 7), (2, 60), (2, 15), (19, 60), (19, 38), (50, 52)]  
>  **Explanation** : Similar as above, just ranges are altered.

 **Method : Using loop**  
This is brute force method in which this task can be performed. In this, we
keep track of start and stop values, and keep adding the missing ranges. At
last, its important to check if any range is left less than higher range.

**Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [(6, 9), (15, 34), (48, 70)]
    Missing range tuples : [(2, 6), (9, 100), (9, 15), (34, 100), (34, 48), (70, 100)]
