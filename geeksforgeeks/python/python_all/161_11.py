Python | Unique values in Matrix



Sometimes we need to find the unique values in a list, that is comparatively
easy and has been discussed earlier. But we can also get a matrix as input i.e
a list of lists, finding unique in them are discussed in this article. Letâ€™s
see certain ways in which this can be achieved.

 **Method #1 : Usingset() \+ list comprehension**  
The set function can be used to convert the individual list to a non-repeating
element list and the list comprehension is used to iterate to each of the
lists.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# checking unique values in matrix

# set() + list comprehension

 

# initializing matrix 

test_matrix = [[1, 3, 1], [4, 5, 3], [1,
2, 4]]

 

# printing the original matrix

print ("The original matrix is : " + str(test_matrix))

 

# using set() + list comprehension

# for checking unique values in matrix

res = list(set(i for j in test_matrix for i in j))

 

# printing result

print ("Unique values in matrix are : " + str(res))  
  
---

 **Output:**

    
    
    The original matrix is : [[1, 3, 1], [4, 5, 3], [1, 2, 4]]
    Unique values in matrix are : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    

  
**Method #2 : Usingchain() + set()**  
The chain function performs the similar task that a list comprehension
performs but in a faster way as it uses iterators for its internal processing
and hence faster.

from itertools import chain

test_matrix = [[1, 3, 1], [4, 5, 3], [1,
2, 4]]

 

# printing the original matrix

print ("The original matrix is : " + str(test_matrix))

 

# using chain() + set()

# for checking unique values in matrix

res = list(set(chain(*test_matrix)))

 

# printing result

print ("Unique values in matrix are : " + str(res))

    The original matrix is : [[1, 3, 1], [4, 5, 3], [1, 2, 4]]
    Unique values in matrix are : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
