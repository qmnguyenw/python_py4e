Python â€“ Grouped Consecutive Range Indices of Elements



Given List of elements, for list of tuples, where each represents the
continuity of occurrence of each element.

>  **Input** : test_list = [1, 1, 5, 6, 5, 5]  
>  **Output** : {1: [(0, 1)], 5: [(2, 2), (4, 5)], 6: [(3, 3)]}  
>  **Explanation** : 5 present at 2nd idx and also in continuation in 4th and
> 5th index, and hence recorded range.
>
>  **Input** : test_list = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]  
>  **Output** : {5: [(0, 5)]}  
>  **Explanation** : Only 5 present, hence recorded.

 **Method : Using groupby() + defaultdict() + len() + loop**

In this, we perform consecutive elements grouping using groupby(),
defaultdict() is used to initialize the tuple list, The len() is used to get
length of repetition.

    The original list : [1, 1, 5, 6, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 1, 5, 5]
    The grouped dictionary : {1: [(0, 1), (9, 9)], 5: [(2, 2), (4, 5), (10, 11)], 6: [(3, 3), (6, 8)]}
