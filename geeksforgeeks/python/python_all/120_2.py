Python | Remove last element from each row in Matrix



Sometimes, while working with Matrix data, we can have a stray element
attached at rear end of each row of matrix. This can be undesired at times and
wished to be removed. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this task can be
performed.

 **Method #1 : Using loop +del \+ list slicing**  
The combination of above functionalities can be used to perform this task. In
this, we run a loop for each row in matrix and remove the rear element using
del.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Remove last element from each row in Matrix

# Using loop + del + list slicing

 

# initialize list

test_list = [[1, 3, 4], [2, 4, 6], [3, 8,
1]]

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list : " + str(test_list))

 

# Remove last element from each row in Matrix

# Using loop + del + list slicing

for ele in test_list: del ele[-1] 

 

# printing result

print("Matrix after removal of rear element from rows : " +
str(test_list))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list : [[1, 3, 4], [2, 4, 6], [3, 8, 1]]
    Matrix after removal of rear element from rows : [[1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 8]]
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension + list slicing**  
The combination of above functions can also be used to perform this task. In
this, we just iterate for each row and delete the rear element using list
slicing.
