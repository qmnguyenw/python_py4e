Python | Nth column Matrix Product



Sometimes, while working with Python Matrix, we may have a problem in which we
require to find the product of a particular column. This can have a possible
application in day-day programming and competitive programming. Letâ€™s discuss
certain ways in which this task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using loop +zip()**  
This task can be solved using the combination of above functions. In this, we
pass in the zip() the list, to access all columns and loop to get product of
columns.

# Nth column Matrix Product 

# using loop + zip() 

 

def prod(val) : 

 res = 1

 for ele in val: 

 res *= ele 

 return res

 

# initialize list 

test_list = [[5, 6, 7], 

 [9, 10, 2], 

 [10, 3, 4]] 

 

# printing original list 

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list)) 

 

# initialize N

N = 2

 

# Nth column Matrix Product 

# using loop + zip() 

res = [prod(idx) for idx in zip(*test_list)][N] 

 

# printing result 

print("Product of Nth column is : " + str(res))

**Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [[5, 6, 7], [9, 10, 2], [10, 3, 4]]
    Product of Nth column is : 56
    

**Method #2 : Using loop**  
This is brute force way to solve this problem. In this, we iterate through the
matrix and take product of column by testing column number.
