Python â€“ Frequency of elements from other list



Given two lists, compute frequency of elements of list 2 that occur in list 1.

>  **Input** : test_list1 = [4, 6, 8, 9], test_list2 = [4, 6, 6, 5, 8, 10, 4,
> 9, 8, 10, 1]  
>  **Output** : {4: 2, 6: 2, 8: 2, 9: 1}  
>  **Explanation** : 4 occurs 2 times, 6 occurs 2 times in second list and so
> on.

>  **Input** : test_list1 = [4, 6, 8, 9], test_list2 = [4, 6, 5, 8, 10, 4, 9,
> 8, 10, 1]  
>  **Output** : {4: 2, 6: 1, 8: 2, 9: 1}  
>  **Explanation** : 4 occurs 2 times, 6 occurs 1 time in second list and so
> on.

 **Method #1 : Using dictionary comprehension + count()**

This is one of the ways in which this task can be performed. In this, count()
is used to extract count of elements in list 2 and dictionary comprehension is
used to compile result and iterate through list 1 values.

test_list1 = [4, 6, 8, 9, 10]

test_list2 = [4, 6, 6, 5, 8, 10, 4, 9,
8, 10, 1]

 

# printing original lists

print("The original list 1 : " + str(test_list1))

print("The original list 2 : " + str(test_list2))

 

# count() used to perform count.

# returns 0 is no occurrence.

# ignores different new elements in list 2

res = {key : test_list2.count(key) for key in test_list1}

 

# printing result 

print("Lists elements Frequency : " + str(res))

 **Output**

    
    
    The original list 1 : [4, 6, 8, 9, 10]
    The original list 2 : [4, 6, 6, 5, 8, 10, 4, 9, 8, 10, 1]
    Lists elements Frequency : {4: 2, 6: 2, 8: 2, 9: 1, 10: 2}
    

**Method #2 : Using Counter() + setdefault() + loop**

This is another way in which this task can be performed. In this, we compute
the frequency using Counter() and assign values using loop. The setdefault()
is used to initialize the counter to 0 for not present values.
