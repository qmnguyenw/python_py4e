Python â€“ Draw Octagonal shape Using Turtle Graphics



In this article, we will learn how to Make an Octagon using Turtle Graphics in
Python. For that lets first know what is Turtle Graphics.

### Turtle graphics

  *  **backward(length):** moves the pen in the backward direction by x unit.
  *  **right(angle):** rotate the pen in the clockwise direction by an angle x.
  *  **left(angle):** rotate the pen in the anticlockwise direction by an angle x.
  *  **penup():** stop drawing of the turtle pen.
  *  **pendown():** start drawing of the turtle pen.

###

## Approach

  * Import the turtle modules.
  * Get a screen to draw on
  * Define an instance for the **turtle.**
  * For a drawing, an **Octagon** executes a loop 8 times.
  * In every iteration move the turtle **100 units** forward and move it left **45 degrees** ( corresponding to 135 degrees between two sides, so 180-135=45 degrees).
  * This will make up an angle of **135** degrees **between 2 sides.**
  *  **8** iterations will make up an **Octagon perfectly.**  
Below is the Python implementation of the above approach:

# defining a turtle instance

geekyTurtle = turtle.Turtle()

# iterating the loop 8 times

for i in range(8):

 

 # moving turtle 100 units forward

 geekyTurtle.forward(100)

 

 # turning turtle 45 degrees so

 # as to make perfect angle for an octagon

 geekyTurtle.left(45)
