Python | Size of string in memory



While working with strings, sometimes, we require to get the size of the
string, i.e the length of it. But there can be situations in which we require
to get the size that the string takes in bytes usually useful in case one is
working with files. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Usinglen() + encode()**

The simplest and initial method that comes to the mind is to convert the
string into a byte format and then extract its size.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# getting size of string in bytes

# using encode() + len()

 

# initializing string 

test_string = "geekforgeeks"

 

# printing original string 

print("The original string : " + str(test_string))

 

# using encode() + len()

# getting size of string in bytes

res = len(test_string.encode('utf-8'))

 

# print result

print("The length of string in bytes : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original string : geekforgeeks
    The length of string in bytes : 12
    

  

  

**Method #2 : Usingsys.getsizeof()**

This task can also be performed by one of the system calls, offered by Python
as in sys function library, the getsizeof function can get us the size in
bytes of desired string.

# using sys.getsizeof()

import sys

 

# initializing string 

test_string = "geekforgeeks"

 

# printing original string 

print("The original string : " + str(test_string))

 

# using sys.getsizeof()

# getting size of string in bytes

res = sys.getsizeof(test_string)

 

# print result

print("The length of string in bytes : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original string : geekforgeeks
    The length of string in bytes : 12
