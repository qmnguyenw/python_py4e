Generating Word Cloud in Python



Word Cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data
in which the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance.
Significant textual data points can be highlighted using a word cloud. Word
clouds are widely used for analyzing data from social network websites.

For generating word cloud in Python, modules needed are â€“ matplotlib, pandas
and wordcloud. To install these packages, run the following commands :

    
    
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install pandas
    pip install wordcloud

The dataset used for generating word cloud is collected from UCI Machine
Learning Repository. It consists of YouTube comments on videos of popular
artists.

# Python program to generate WordCloud

 

# importing all necessery modules

from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import pandas as pd

 

# Reads 'Youtube04-Eminem.csv' file 

df = pd.read_csv(r"Youtube04-Eminem.csv", encoding ="latin-1")

 

comment_words = ''

stopwords = set(STOPWORDS)

 

# iterate through the csv file

for val in df.CONTENT:

 

 # typecaste each val to string

 val = str(val)

 

 # split the value

 tokens = val.split()

 

 # Converts each token into lowercase

 for i in range(len(tokens)):

 tokens[i] = tokens[i].lower()

 

 comment_words += " ".join(tokens)+" "

 

wordcloud = WordCloud(width = 800, height = 800,

 background_color ='white',

 stopwords = stopwords,

 min_font_size = 10).generate(comment_words)

 

# plot the WordCloud image 

plt.figure(figsize = (8, 8), facecolor = None)

plt.imshow(wordcloud)

plt.axis("off")

plt.tight_layout(pad = 0)

 

plt.show()

The above word cloud has been generated using Youtube04-Eminem.csv file in
the dataset. One interesting task might be generating word clouds using other
csv files available in the dataset.

  

  

 **Advantages of Word Clouds :**

  1. Analyzing customer and employee feedback.
  2. Identifying new SEO keywords to target.

 **Drawbacks of Word Clouds :**

  1. Word Clouds are not perfect for every situation.
  2. Data should be optimized for context.
