Python | Remove given element from the list



Given a list, write a Python program to remove the given element (list may
have duplicates) from given list. There are multiple ways we can do this task
in Python. Letâ€™s see some of Pythonic ways to do this task.

 **Method #1:** Using pop() method [Remove given element found first.]

# Python program to remove given element from the list

list1 = [1, 9, 8, 4, 9, 2, 9] 

 

# Printing initial list 

print ("original list : "+ str(list1)) 

 

remove = 9

 

# using pop() 

# to remove list element 9

if remove in list1: 

 list1.pop(list1.index(remove)) 

 

# Printing list after removal 

print ("List after element removal is : " + str(list1))

**Output:**

    
    
    original list : [1, 9, 8, 4, 9, 2, 9]
    List after element removal is : [1, 8, 4, 9, 2, 9]
    

  
**Method #2:** Using remove() method

list1 = [1, 9, 8, 4, 9, 2, 9] 

 

# Printing initial list 

print ("original list : "+ str(list1)) 

 

# using remove() to remove list element 9

list1.remove(9) 

 

 

# Printing list after removal 

print ("List after element removal is : " + str(list1))

**Output:**

  

  

    
    
    original list : [1, 9, 8, 4, 9, 2, 9]
    List after element removal is : [1, 8, 4, 9, 2, 9]
