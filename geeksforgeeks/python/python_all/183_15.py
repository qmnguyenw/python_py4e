Python Program to Count ways to reach the nâ€™th stair



There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top.
The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of
ways, the person can reach the top.

Consider the example shown in diagram. The value of n is 3. There are 3 ways
to reach the top. The diagram is taken from Easier Fibonacci puzzles

 return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

 

# returns no. of ways to reach s'th stair

 **Output:**

    
    
    Number of ways =  5
    

The time complexity of the above implementation is exponential (golden ratio
raised to power n). It can be optimized to work in O(Logn) time using the
previously discussed Fibonacci function optimizations.
