Python Program for Find remainder of array multiplication divided by n



Given multiple numbers and a number n, the task is to print the remainder
after multiply all the number divide by n.  
 **Examples:**

    
    
    **Input :** arr[] = {100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14}, 
                n = 11
    **Output :** 9
    100 x 10 x 5 x 25 x 35 x 14 = 61250000 % 11 = 9

 **Naive approach:** First multiple all the numbers then take % by n then find
the remainder, But in this approach, if the number is maximum of 2^64 then it
gives the wrong answer.  
 **Approach that avoids overflow :** First take a remainder or individual
number like arr[i] % n. Then multiply the remainder with the current result.
After multiplication, again take the remainder to avoid overflow. This works
because of the distributive properties of modular arithmetic. ( a * b) % c = (
( a % c ) * ( b % c ) ) % c

lens = len(arr)

n = 11
