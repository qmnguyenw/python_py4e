Python | Chunk Tuples to N



Sometimes, while working with data, we can have a problem in which we may need
to perform chunking of tuples each of size N. This is popular in applications
in which we need to supply data in chunks. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which
this task can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehenion**  
This is brute and shorthand method to perform this task. In this, we split the
N elements at a time and construct a new tuple for them.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of

# Chunk Tuples to N

# using list comprehension

 

# initialize tuple

test_tup = (10, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 8, 3,
4)

 

# printing original tuple

print("The original tuple : " + str(test_tup))

 

# initialize N 

N = 3

 

# Chunk Tuples to N

# using list comprehension

res = [test_tup[i : i + N] for i in range(0,
len(test_tup), N)]

 

# printing result

print("The tuples after chunking are : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original tuple : (10, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 8, 3, 4)
    The tuples after chunking are : [(10, 4, 5), (6, 7, 6), (8, 3, 4)]
    

**Method #2 : Usingzip() + iter()**  
The combination of above functions can also be used to solve this problem. In
this, we use zip() to combine chunks and iter() converts to suitable format.
