Python | Every Kth element removal in List



We generally wish to employ a particular function to all the elements in a
list. But sometimes, according to requirement we would wish to remove certain
elements of the list, basically to every Kth element in list. Letâ€™s discuss
certain ways in which this can be performed.

 **Method #1 : Using list comprehension +enumerate()**  
The functionality of getting every Kth number of list can be done with the
help of list comprehension and enumerate function helps in the iteration of
the whole list.

# Python3 code to demonstrate

# Every Kth element removal in List

# using list comprehension + enumerate()

 

# initializing list 

test_list = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12]

 

# printing the original list

print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

 

# initializing K 

K = 3

 

# using list comprehension + enumerate()

# Every Kth element removal in List

# Remove every third element

res = [i for j, i in enumerate(test_list) if j % K
!= 0]

 

# printing result

print ("The list after removing every Kth element : " + str(res))

 **Output :**

    
    
    The original list is : [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12]
    The list after removing every kth element : [4, 5, 7, 8, 12]
    

**Method #2 : Using list comprehension + list slicing**  
Above mentioned functions can help to perform these tasks. The list
comprehension does the task of iteration in list and list slicing does the
extraction of every Kth element.
